        <title>Part 1: Introduction &amp; Obtaining R01 Materials Online </title>
        <para id="id1169796454323">
          <emphasis effect="italics">Welcome everyone, thank you for coming to the NLM professional development workshops. We have a fantastic person here to talk about professional development. This is Dr. Phyllis McBride. And she is the Director of Proposal Development here at Rice. She has also worked and developed proposals at the CH2 Andell(?) and EDS. She is a Ph.D. in English and we’re very lucky to have her here today. </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para id="id1169803141898">Thank you. Can everyone hear all right? We were having some problems with the sound a little bit earlier. First of all, I’m really glad that you’re here today. And I just want to say right up front, that anyone who takes time out of a schedule as a busy as I know all of your schedules are, is doing yourself a really service. You’re going to be learning some information, I hope, that will help make you much more competitive when you’re beginning to apply for grants. Either in, as assisting with, let’s say, one of your advisors or a mentor in your lab, or whether you’re ultimately applying for those grants for yourself. There are so many people that always kind of amazes me who have never had any introduction to grant writing, whatsoever. And yet, when they graduate, they’re suddenly tossed into a situation where they have to go out and secure grant funds. So anything that you can do like this is going to give you a little bit of a head start for above everybody else. So that’s always a good thing to know. </para>
        <para id="id7013791">What I wanted to do is just give you a little bit of an idea of what we’re talking about today. The first thing I’m going to do is just give you a very quick walkthrough the web because one of the things that is probably the hardest about applying for a grant is actually finding the funding opportunity and finding the area on grants.gov where you would upload that opportunity. And so I’m going to let you have some idea of how to navigate that. We will then talk about the NIH research project grant, which is also known as the R01, take a short break, and then come back and discuss the NIH Pathway to Independence Award, which is also called the K99 or R00. And R00 is what I should say. And we’ll conclude by going over some strategies and tips for success, things that you can do in any proposal, whether it’s an R01 research project grant, or a Pathways to Independence Proposal that can help make you have a much better chance of success. And we’ll end with questions, so if you have questions along the way, please feel free to jump in and let me know, and we’ll answer them as we go. If you have questions that you would prefer ask at the end of the presentation, just jot those down, and we’ll be sure to leave ample time for that. Any questions so far? Okay. </para>
        <para id="id1169797256568">Oops. Oh. Is it going to go? Okay. </para>
        <para id="id1169804202092">The first thing that, I think, the critical question to ask yourself is: Where do you begin? I think probably many of you have heard your colleagues talking about writing a grant proposal and many of them are not smiling when they’re talking about it, and they look rather distressed and they are. And so what I </para>
        <para id="id1169796453702">wanted to do is try to offer you a plan of attack for how you can go about this process. The first thing that you want to do is establish some kind of logical process for the application process itself. And this is going to be slightly different for each person, some people are very linear and they want to work through it exactly in certain order, some people prefer to jump around from section to section while they’re working on the proposal. There will be times when you are working on a team proposal, where you’ll be sort of dividing and conquering and having some people work on one section while others are working on another, and whichever approach you’re using, you want to make sure that you’re consistent with it. As you become more and more comfortable working on grants, if you follow that same process from grant to grant, what you’ll find is that, fairly quickly, you won’t be having to think so much about just the logistics of how do I find the funding opportunity and how do I fill out all of these forms and upload everything. You’ll actually be able to think about your research. What a concept! So always a good thing to do. </para>
        <para id="id5056011">The key thing that you want to do, also, is define a really good idea. And in today’s competitive grant market, one of the things that you’ve got to do is make sure that your idea goes beyond good and that it’s actually great. Just a truly superb idea because you have to keep in mind everyone is looking for funds, we’re short on funds, especially at the federal level, and that’s where everybody looks because that’s where the big money is. So what often times happens if you have reviewers who are evaluating proposals, not just trying to make decisions between which is the excellent proposal vs the good proposal. They’re making decisions between we have all of these excellent proposals, and which of those are we going to be selecting? So one of the things that you’ll want to do is really talk about your ideas and so, right, you’re able to refine them as much as possible. </para>
        <para id="id1169796403948">Once you have your idea, and I would say only have you have your idea, you would then begin looking for funding opportunities. And the reason I say this order is the most appropriate is that it ensures that your research agenda drives the funding opportunities that you’re looking for. A lot of times people will hear about a funding opportunity that offers millions of dollars and they try to force or squeeze their proposal, their research to fit that so that they can go after that pot of money. But what often times happen, is that reviewers see that you’re trying to force that, and they just don’t buy it. And so it’s often times much wiser to go ahead and stay true to your research idea and just constantly look for funding opportunities, and then when you see the right one for your research, you’ll know that you’ve got a good fit, and you’ll have a much better chance at success. </para>
        <para id="id1169805116704">After you’ve found the funding opportunity and you know what agency you’re going to be applying to. For most of you, it’ll be NIH, probably some of you will apply to NSF or DoD since DoD has a lot of medical research programs also, you’ll want to learn as much about that agency as you can. And you can do this, of course, by getting on the agency’s webpage and reading about the agency as a whole. Reading about the specific institute or center, if you’re applying to NIH, that you’re targeting, and also look at information on the specific program that you’re targeting. The other thing that you can do to find out about the mission is simply talk to your colleagues. Talk to some sincere colleagues who you know have been funded at a particular agency, because they can give you some insights that aren’t going to be on the webpages, sort of insider tips, if you will. And also talk to your colleagues and find out what kinds of luck have they had at applying to agencies. It’s really nice if people are willing to share, if not, an actual copy of the review comments that they’ve gotten back after submitting their proposal, if they at least sort of tell you, well ‘this is the thing they dinged me on’, or ‘this they really liked.’ That’s really a way to help one another. </para>
        <para id="id1169799884724">And then, finally, the next that you want to do is just begin an iterative process of talking about your idea with your colleagues, refining it, talking about it with some more colleagues, refining it, and when you feel like you’ve got a pretty good idea of what it is you really want to do, at that point, it’s the time to go ahead and talk with the program manager at the agency that you’re applying to. People always hesitate to do this, and I can’t emphasize enough the importance of talking with your program manager. We’re actually paying them with our tax dollars. They work for us, okay, so and they’re also really eager to be able to help you because they are people who care enough about the discipline that they’re working in to volunteer to be a program manager usually for about a three-year term. That’s a significant commitment. They want to know what is happening on the ground, so to speak, in the various disciplines related to their own, and so, giving them a chance to hear about your ideas, and offer some suggestions on how you could improve the idea, or how you could best present the idea, is really, extraordinarily helpful. It’s also nice because if you talk to your program manager and they say, you know what, ‘that’s a great idea, but it’s not right for our particular program or agency,’ they can then refer to you to the appropriate program or agency, and that saves you a whole lot of time and heartache because you’re not preparing an application that’s not going nowhere. </para>
        <para id="id1169786408849">(inaudible question) </para>
        <para id="id1169803951439">Absolutely. Absolutely. And there will be times when you might submit an application that really, you know, everything is becoming interdisciplinary so the lines between institutes at NIH are starting to blur a little bit, so there might be instances where two different institutes within NIH would co-sponsor your grant. If you find that after talking to a program manager they say, “well, we really like it, but it’s not a perfect fit, you should talk with this institute,” and if they give you that same response, try to get both of them on the phone and say, “hey, is there any way, you both seem interested, but it doesn’t seem like a perfect fit, is there any way that you would be interested in sponsoring half of the project, of whatever percentage of the project they feel comfortable with.” </para>
        <para id="id1169799199354">(inaudible question) </para>
        <para id="id8402744">Actually, what will happen is when you submit your grant application, it won’t be submitted directly to an institute, it will be submitted to the Center for Scientific Review, and the people at the Scientific Review will look at your application, especially your ‘Specific Aims’ section and you’re ‘Approach’ section, I’m sorry your ‘Significance’ section and they will then make decisions based on their experience which institute your application should go to, and which particular study section your application should go to. If you want to try to have a little bit more control over that process you can do that by simply, you can include a cover letter with your proposal and you can indicate “I am interested in having this application reviewed by Study Section X” and you can give them the name of that Study section. What’s great about NIH is that they publish not only all the names of the study sections, but the rosters for all of the study sections, so you can actually go online, click on the study section that you think is appropriate for your research, and what you might see is that all of that people in that study section are really working on a slightly different idea, so what you may have to do is keep looking, and you may find a study section that by title doesn’t seem like it would be the best one for your research, but based on the people who are on the panel and the kind of research they do, you realize that that would be the best place. And again, that’s also something that you can talk to your program manager about. Most people will, I think, have made the recommendation that if it’s your first time to apply, you should just let the Center for Scientific Review do their job and shuttle your proposal to the right study section, after you have had success with a particular proposal and you kind of have a better idea of how the whole process </para>
        <para id="id1169796619343">works, at that point, you might want to go ahead and start indicating the particular section you wanted to go to as well. </para>
        <para id="id8457329">Okay, the other thing that I can’t emphasize enough and we all know this, and we never do it, is to start early. As early as possible, and I say this because there are so many, the reason, all of your colleagues look distressed when they’re working on proposals is that there is a slew of forms and documents that have to be filled out and put together and uploaded before you can even get your proposal in to be reviewed. Bless you! And so allergy season, and so, what I wanted to do is kind of walk you through a little bit of some of these publications. PHS398 is the forms that you would use for the proposal proper, so for your specific aims, your research strategy, those kinds of sections. Those are downloaded from NIH. There is another set of forms that are primarily administrative in content, which are called the SF424, Standard Form 424. And in those you download from grants.gov. In addition, if you’re working on a career development award, such as the Pathway to Independence, you would need to download that particular supplemental form grants.gov as well. </para>
        <para id="id1169799250286">So, the question now is how to get to, to some of these forms. So if you’re looking for, if you’re just trying to find a funding opportunity, or a program announcement as they’re called at NIH, other agencies will call these “program solicitations” “requests for proposals”, “request for application”, at some agencies, you’ll hear them call “BAAs” or “Broad agency announcements”. Essentially, those are all terms that are referring to the instructions for your proposal. And, or for the actual solicitation itself. And as I’ve said, those are sometimes very difficult to find. So if you’re looking for just the funding opportunity, for let’s say, the major research project grant, you would start at the NIH webpage, click on ‘grants and funding’ and then when you see this funding heading under that, you will see that there is something called “unsolicited applications.” I don’t know, can everyone see that okay? Unsolicited applications, that is the same term that’s used that the alternate term is ‘parent announcements’ and what this means, it’s a great thing for all of you because some agencies will put out requests for proposals and they’ll say, “and this is what you have to conduct research on,” and you’re limited by that. NIH and other agencies, you have the opportunity to come up with your own idea and submit it to the agency that you think is most appropriate for funding your project and you do this without them asking you to, they don’t have to put out a special request for proposal. All they do is just say, ‘hey, if you’ve got an idea, create a proposal and submit it to us.” The reason there is an announcement at all is actually because of an administrative part of the standard form 424, so it’s kind of like one form begets another form begets another form. And so there is a parent announcement for a variety of different awards. The R mechanisms are for research, if you look at the R01, you’ll see that you can click on and get the announcement. I also wanted to show you there’s training announcements, career development announcements, those of you who are interested in the K99/R00, you can come down and get that announcement right here as well. </para>
        <para id="id5011735">So you would just simply, when you see R01, slide over, click on the announcement number, and you’re going to actually get a copy of the proposal solicitation, and this is usually about a 15-25 page document, it gives you every kind of information you could possibly want and then some about the proposal that you would need to write to respond to this particular funding mechanism and we’ll talk about that a little bit more as well in a little bit. </para>
        <para id="id1169802151203">If you are, if you have found your solicitation, let’s say you’ve decided you have a great idea, you’re going to submit an unsolicited application by using the R01 funding mechanism. Now what you want to do is find out okay, how do I actually, once I’ve created this application, how do I apply? And you apply through grants.gov. So you go to the homepage for grants.gov, and you click on ‘apply for grants.’ The </para>
        <para id="id7305190">first step is simply downloading the grant application package and what you would do at this point is put in the funding opportunity number, which you will be able to get off the funding opportunity that I just showed you a picture of. In this case, it’s PA for Program Announcement, 10 and 067. So you enter that and it gives you a list of 2 things. The one of two different forms. The one that you want is on top because as you can see it’s used for submissions that have due dates after January 25th of 2010. You click on download and then you can continue. Before I go on, there is a spot right in here where you can sign up for alerts, if there are any changes in the particular funding mechanism. The chances that there are going to be changes to a parent announcement are pretty slim, though it does happen. However, if you’re applying to a specific request for proposals or a request for applications, in those instances, it would be really wise to put your e-mail address in here, and what they’ll do is any time there’s an update to that solicitation, they’ll e-mail you and let you know so that you don’t get a big surprise when you’re submitting and find out, they’ve added this section to the proposal, and I didn’t even know they were going to do that, so that’s a nice thing to do. You can download the application instructions and download the application package… supposedly you can. It’s working. </para>
        <para id="id1169796475099">So this is what the application would really look like. The one thing that they do that’s really helpful in this whole mass of forms that they have you fill out is that on some forms they actually prefill the forms for you, which is really nice, so in this instance, this is the program solicitation for the research grant, the research project grant, the R01, they’ve actually filled that information in for you. They’ve put the opportunity number in for you. They’ve given you the names of the forms that you’ll be using. The opportunity open date is the date that this particular parent announcement became available, when it first hit the streets so to speak. The close date usually refers to a date that you can no longer submit an application under that; however, in this instance, that’s not the case so don’t worry about that too much. If it said expiration date, then you’ll realize you would know that you can’t submit to it anymore. But the close date is slightly different. It gives you all of the contact information for the agency, which is nice if you have questions. It’s right there. And the other thing that’s really nice about this document is that they fill in which other forms and documents that you have to create for this particular proposal. So in this instance, you need the SF424 for the research and related, that’s what the R stands for. The project performance and site locations, other project information, senior key person profile, a cover page supplement, the actual research plan which is the heart of your proposal, and a checklist. Then they have a section called optional documents and one of the things is optional, is for instance, a cover letter. If you want to have a cover letter, you can. If you don’t want to, it’s not a big deal. I would say if you have the opportunity to include one, do, because it’s a chance for you to highlight just a few things about your proposal and also a chance to help make that your proposal gets sent the appropriate study sections. So you want to use key words in this letter that you really are reflective of your research. </para>
        <para id="id1169802237157">Now, the other things that they have in here, they’re putting them as optional documents, and the reason that they’re actually required. If you’re submitting a proposal, you have to submit a budget. The reason this is listed in optional is because you can submit one of two different kinds of budgets. If you’re requesting less than $250,000 a year, you would use the modular budget. It’s the easiest budget in the world. You just simply request the number of modules, and they come in $25,000, each one is worth $25,000, you just incorporate the number of modules that you need for year 1, year 2, year 3, 4, 5, and so forth. If on the other hand, you’re really going to go for it, and you’re going to request more than $250,000 per year. In that instance, you would need to get permission from your program manager to proceed. If you they give you permission, what you would have to do is provide a line item detailed budget so if they’re going to give out really huge chunks of money, they want to make they know exactly how it’s going to be spent, so you would use one or the other. And the final document that’s listed here is the sub-award budget attachment. There will be sometimes that because of the nature of the </para>
        <para id="id1169804620849">research you’re doing, you’ll realize that you need to have someone on your project team, even if you’re applying for a R01, which people think as an individual investigator proposal so that they provide the expertise that you don’t have. It may be that you’re working on a larger type proposal that’s for a center, and in that instance, you would have a number of different people who would be collaborating with you. And many of them, if they’re from other institutions, would need, they would need to submit their budgets. And when you get your own budget and all of the subcontractor budgets, you can then put together a, come up with a final dollar amount for your proposal. This gives you just a few instructions and this is just a one-page document that’s all that you have right there. So that’s how you can locate some of these documents. </para>
        <para id="id1169800477530">(inaudible question) </para>
        <para id="id1169800262140">Yes, we’re about to look at them. There’s a whole little stack, and this is just for a single proposal. </para>
      </section>
      <section id="id1169804416548">
        <title>Part 2: R01 Research Grant </title>
        <para id="id5071238">So for the research project grant, the R01, actually, let’s see, we’ll talk a little about the R01 first. This is actually what we had seen earlier. This is actually the public health service PHS398 funding opportunity that you get, that you can download from the NIH webpage. You can also download these from the grants.gov webpage as well. And this is going to give you, as I said, just about every piece of information that you could possibly need or want for your application. </para>
        <para id="id1169789514360">The research project grant is overall, is I think, a very interesting one. It’s sort of the original of all of the grants that NIH offered. It’s considered one of their standard funding mechanisms. It’s the grant that is awarded the most often at NIH and it has a very simple purpose and that is simply to provide funding and support for a very particular well-defined project. So it’s essentially, if you have a large research project that might be made up of a number of different experiments and so forth, this would be the kind of funding mechanism that you would want to use to request support. One of the things that you’ll find is that for some funding mechanisms like the R01, virtually every institute and center within NIH will participate and that again, leaves this very open for you to be able to come up with your idea and submit it to whichever institute you think is most appropriate. However, you need to be aware that each institute and center does have a specific research agenda. Some of them focus on a particular disease. Some on a certain body system, so this is just a list starting, if you can look over in the top right corner, you’ll see quick links. It’s got acronyms for all of the NIH institutes and centers as you can see there’s quite a few of them. And you can click on any one of those to go to the institute or center that you’re interested in learning more about. The office of the director actually does fund some research, though probably not as much as the other institutes. And they just go through in alphabetical order to list the institutes and centers. The first one listed is the National Cancer Institute. They provide a very quick summary, and then you can click if you want to get a further description of what it is that they do, and what they fund. So when you’re trying to learn a little bit about the agency’s mission, this would be the perfect place to go to get that information. </para>
        <para id="id1169796262223">The key features of the research project grant is that first of all, it is an unsolicited application, so you’re the one that gets to drive the research, you don’t have to try to make your research fit someone else’s research agenda. The eligibility is wide open, basically, they just say, if you have the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research, you can be a principal investigator for an R01 proposal. One thing that I really want to point out also, is that the R01 does not require US citizenship and so I know that with some agencies it’s a real struggle to be able to find funding opportunities that you can apply for if you’re not a US citizen, so it’s nice to know that there are some </para>
        <para id="id1169796441870">out there that you can apply for with no problems. The budget for an R01, you can request essentially, what they say, is request the amount of money that you need. Don’t try to under, sort of, come up with a low-ball estimate thinking that it will help you, because it won’t. Don’t try to pad the budget because the people who are reviewing it are also researchers, they’ll know if you’re padding the budget. </para>
        <para id="id1503841">You just want to ask for what you need, and what that means is that you really have to think through your project and every aspect of your project, well before you put the budget together so you’re sure you can request the appropriate amount. You can have direct costs of $250,000 per year or less. How many of you know what direct costs are vs. indirect costs? A few of you? Direct costs are costs that can be tied directly to your work on a particular project. So, these would be things like your salary, that for the time you spend working on the project. It could be travel that’s associated with the project. It might be any kind of materials and supplies or equipment that you purchase for the project. Those are things that all have a specific price tag on them so you can add those up, and say ‘okay, we know we’re at $250,000 or less.” Indirect costs, and so you know that every year, let’s say you were able to hit that magic number of $250,000, and people try to get it as close to that as they can, they don’t want to lose anything, then once you’re able to do that, you’ll put that into your modular, your modular budget. For indirect costs, and you would get that $250,000 every year. Indirect costs would be given to you on top of what you get for direct costs. Indirect costs are the things that are not directly tied to your project. These are things like, another term for it is ‘facilities and administrative costs’ or ‘overhead’ if you’re in business. So these are things like electricity, it’s really hard to figure out how much electricity you’re using when you work on your project, or water, or computer resources or the library, and those kinds of things. All of those are indirect costs. And the universities and institutions all negotiate with the federal government to come up with an indirect cost rate for their particular institution. Basically, it’s a very complicated formula that allows them to determine what the university is having to spend in order to keep research going at that institution. And that would be the indirect costs, so these are great proposals for you to be able to win because you’re getting all the direct costs and your institution is getting the indirect costs as well. Some institutions will share the indirect costs, sometimes it goes strictly, let’s say, to the office of research, sometimes it might go part of it might go to the Dean’s office, sometimes another part of it might go to your department. Some department chairs are very kind and they pass that money on to you so that you have some additional funds that are unrestricted, you can use for your projects. So if you see that there’s just something you didn’t think of when you were putting the proposal together that you really need, that would be a source of funds for you to be able to get that and so that’s really nice, a nice thing to have, if they’ll do that. And that’s something you might always try negotiating with your department chair or your dean, in fact. Some departments in colleges are more flexible than others. </para>
        <para id="id1169798639617">The project can be up to 5 years in duration. I will tell that with the budget being what it is right now, most people are not getting 5 years of funding. They’re getting 4 years of funding. So what you can do is submit a project that’s designed for 5 years of support, just be prepared in the back of your mind for NIH to come back and say, ‘we really like your project, but we can only give you 4 years of support.” And that point, you would work with your office of sponsored research to negotiate a change in the scope of work, because obviously you don’t want to cram 5 years’ worth of research into a 4 year project period. You would want to drop some of the work off that project. Make sense? </para>
        <para id="id1169804394133">Okay, and then the other thing that’s especially nice about the R01 application is the grant cycle. There are many agencies and funding opportunities out there where you get one shot at applying every year. With NIH or almost all of their grants, you get 3 opportunities to apply. So they have 3 grant cycles. As you can see those last 3 columns, cycles 1, 2, and 3, the deadlines are spread throughout the year. So </para>
        <para id="id1169792701386">let’s say that you are working frantically on a proposal and you’re going to try to hit the February 5th deadline and you realize it’s just not going to happen no matter what you do. Then what you can do is say, “well, I didn’t make it for that one, but I could still make the June 5th deadline, so I’m going to continue working intensely on this proposal.” And that way, when the June 5th deadline rolls around, I will not only have a complete proposal, but I will have a proposal that has been vetted or has been reviewed very, very thoroughly. So that you have the best possible proposal to submit at that point. What you’ll find, there’s an actual page on the NIH website that gives you a list of all the standard due dates for all of the different types of proposals so the funding, every funding mechanism, has what’s called an ‘activity code.’ As you see in that left hand column, the activity code will, if you just want to skim through this list and find the ones that you’re looking for. So if you’re looking to submit a brand new R01 application, you would see that the deadlines are Feb 5th, June 5th, and October 5th, that very top line. If, however, you’ve already submitted a R01, and it’s about to come to an end, and you want to get it renewed for another 5 years, you would not submit your proposal on those same dates. If you drop down to the third row, where it says ‘renewal, resubmission, and revisions”, in that instance, the proposals would go in on Mar 5th, July 5th, and November 5th. As you’re skimming through this list, be really, really careful about whether you’re getting the dates for new proposals or for renewals, resubmissions, and revisions. </para>
        <para id="id1169803861913">(inaudible question) </para>
        <para id="id1169793220093">What the general rule is, and I don’t know the specifically about the T32s, but generally what happens is, you can submit one application and then you get one, if you’re not funded, you can submit one revised application and that’s it. It used to be that you could submit an application and then you had 2 more chances and I think what they’ve decided is that most people who are going to be funded were going to be funded on either the first or second application that they submitted. But if they were submitting a third one, generally speaking, for whatever reason, that project wasn’t going to be funded. It might be that there was some kind of experimental flaw with the project, it might be that it just did not generate enough enthusiasm for the reviewers, but if you go ahead and submit a third application, of course, that’s just more time that you’re spending on it. And reviewers would rather see you start over with either a new application completely or a new topic all together. And so in a sense, even though it kind of hurts not to have that extra chance, they’re saving you a lot of time. Yes? </para>
        <para id="id1169791670917">(inaudible question) </para>
        <para id="id1169785998995">A revision would be if you have submitted an application and you have made, you’ve realized there are some errors in it or something that you need to correct, you can submit it as a revision document. So it’s more, as the name implies, really allowing you to go in and make some corrections. But typically, those are going to be pretty rare. What you’re going to see mostly is the new, the renewals and the resubmissions. And they information for the K awards is up there as well. The codes, yeah, typically these codes will give you an idea of what kind activity each funding mechanism supports. The R series supports research. The K series supports career awards, why they used a K and not a C, I don’t know. And so there’s a whole set of those. </para>
        <para id="id1169804340095">Once you’ve actually decided, okay, I’m going to apply for a R01 application, I’ve got my idea, I’ve figured out which institute I want to target, I’ve now gone to grants.gov and I have downloaded the application package, and again, this is what it will look like. It will have everything, all of the administrative information filled in for you, and on the left, it will give you a list of the mandatory documents as well as the optional documents that you’ll need. </para>
        <para id="id1169802770758">Now there’s a lot of other forms that are attached to this and those, that’s what I want to go over now. So if you pull out the packet that has a copy of the SF424 form on it, I’m not going to go into this in detail because all of our eyes will glaze over, including my own. But there’s a few things that I do want to point out along the way. So as I said, and right up front, you’ll see that it gives you the name of the funding opportunity that you’re applying for. If you pull up an application and it doesn’t have the correct name, go back in and try that again because you want to make sure that you’ve got the right application, or the right program targeted. You don’t want your application to be going into the wrong, the wrong program. There is a list of mandatory and optional documents. These little arrows that you see right here are a way that you can indicate when you’re done with one section of the proposal, you move it over to the complete section and it’s just a way for you to very easily track at a glance, where you’re at in the proposal process. You will also have what’s called a cover component. That’s the second sheet. This is primarily, again, more administrative information. What will happen is that, if you see the grayed in fields on the screen, these are bright yellow, you can’t miss it. And those are required fields. And some will be required for some funding mechanisms. There might be different required fields for other mechanisms, which is why you want to make sure you’ve downloaded the right one, so you give them all the information that they want. This is actually a two-page form. The cover is, and this is just simply filling in the information. One thing that’s really nice is that, I think, all of you will have an office of sponsored research or sponsor research projects at your institution, and there should be people there who would, will be very familiar with these forms, and who can either answer any questions that you have about them, or can even help you fill some of them out, depending on how your organization is set up. Sometimes they’ll do all of them except just a couple for you, and they’ll have you do the ones that only you could answer. </para>
        <para id="id1169802985748">Another thing that you have to do is provide information on the project site. For your project, most of you, your project site is going to be your home institution because that’s where your lab is going to be, that’s where your human subjects, let’s say are going to be. In some instances though, you might be partnering with another institution, and in that instance, you would provide the information for not only your institution, but if you go to the bottom of the page, you’ll see ‘additional locations’ and you would write the locations for any other institution that might participating in this research and state where they’re located as well. </para>
        <para id="id1169793216455">Other project information is collecting the kinds of information that it’s, it’s really critical to make sure is in place. These are very important things like human subjects research, vertebrate animals, proprietary or privileged information. If your project impacts the environment, if you’re going to be working in a location that’s a historic site that might be disturbed in some way, if you’re working outside the United States, essentially, this is just a way to sort of flag these items for your reviewers and for the administrations at NIH so that they’ll be able to make sure you’ve included everything in your application package. </para>
        <para id="id1169798752278">This is also the part of the application where you upload a number of different documents that you create and save Microsoft Word or whatever word processing package that you use. So one, the projects summary, this is just a one-page document, the project narrative, the bibliography and references cited, facilities and other resources, equipment and any other attachments. And as I’ve said, these will be slightly different for different funding mechanisms. </para>
        <para id="id1169796511168">You will also have to fill out a page about your senior personnel. And you will be the most senior of all if you’re the principal investigator, so your name will go at the very top of the form. And then you will </para>
        <para id="id8403853">continue to fill out information for each other member of your proposal team. And this will give you the opportunity after you’ve added the information for one person, if they do you need to add information for another, and if you click yes, it brings up another set of blank fields for you to enter that information in. This is the kind of thing that if you, it’s the end of the day, and you feel a little brain dead, but you want to get something else done, these are some good things to work on. They have to be done, they’re kind of time-consuming, but they don’t require great intellectual effort on your part, so they’re nice things to work on in those instances. </para>
        <para id="id1169796807454">For every person that you have on your project team, you’re going to need to upload a biographical sketch for that person. NIH has a special form for biographical sketches, which is on the next page and it’s limited to 4 pages. You also need to upload a list of all of their grant support that they have received over the last 3 years. The reason you’re adding that is, primarily so that your reviewers can make sure there’s no scientific overlap between two of your projects. Yes? </para>
        <para id="id1169799853592">(inaudible question) </para>
        <para id="id1169798472177">It’s actually, it is part, on your biographical sketch, you can list your grant support going back further than 3 years, so if you have a relevant project that you finished 4 years ago, but you really want them to know that you worked on that project, you can list it in your biographical sketch. On the current/pending support form though, you would omit it because it wouldn’t be recent enough. Yeah, that’s a very good question. </para>
        <para id="id1169803536593">So, you would fill out this current/pending support form. And again, there’s a special form for that and as you can see at the bottom of the page, you just click the attachment button and you would upload a .pdf document. </para>
        <para id="id4907700">The biographical sketch, as I said, is limited to 4 pages. There are, the first page I have given you provides the instructions for the biographical sketch. The following pages provide an actual sample so you can see what one looks like. One of the things that I wanted to point out is that they have added a new component to the biographical sketch, and that’s the personal statement. So if you already have a NIH biographical sketch put together, go back and take a look at it and make sure that you have that section added in. And if you don’t go ahead and insert that now so you don’t forget because they will be looking for that now. </para>
        <para id="id1169805609324">The other thing that I think is very nice that you can do in the personal statement, is if there is some reason that your productivity has slowed down for some reason, you have an opportunity here to explain why. So if you had family obligations, an ill parent or child, what have you, you can put that information in here. I really like the way, that on this sample, they’ve done this. It’s the last few sentences. They kept it short and sweet and simply said, “during 2005-2006, my career was disrupted due to family obligations.” That’s it. That’s all they said. You don’t want to belabor the point. You just want to sum it up and move on and she immediately says, “however, upon returning to the field, I immediately resumed my research projects and collaborations and successfully competed for NIH support.” So you don’t want to emphasize times that you’re research has slowed down for whatever reason. Yes? </para>
        <para id="id1169798558556">(inaudible question) </para>
        <para id="id1169797323265">Okay, the next, a few pages back you will see what’s called the “other support form.” And as you can see, this is a list of grant support that this particular person has had. There’s then a cover page supplement. There are more cover pages that you have to fill out; it’s really kind of crazy. And then you’ll come to probably the most important of all, and this is the “PHS398 Research Plan Component.” And if you look on the left hand column of this page, you’ll see that there are, is, an entire list of documents or forms that you need to fill out and then simply upload to grants.gov. The key ones of course, are for the research plan section. The real heart of your proposal. </para>
        <para id="id1169795248256">There is a checklist that comes after that, another cover letter component, and then the budget. And the budget that I’ve included here is the sample of the modular budget. This is the one you would use if you’re applying for $250,000 or less per year and believe me, it’s worth being able to go with the modular budget. It will make your life, much much easier. So that's what we’ve got just for our forms. Yes? </para>
        <para id="id1169797617727">(Question) </para>
        <para id="id1169797112219">Yes, you will submit a budget justification. And you want budget justification to be a true justification. You want to explain the rationale for why you have put a specific person on your project, what’s the expertise that they bring that you don’t have that you need, why do you need a certain set of materials, why do you need to make a certain trip, you want to really provide a true rationale for that because when funds are tight, the more persuasively you can word your justification, the more likely that the reviewers will be to let you keep that item on your budget so you definitely want to justify as much as possible. </para>
        <para id="id1169796295598">Okay. We kind of gave a quick overview of the R01. I want to go into in a little bit more depth at this point, and the reason I’m looking at the R01 is because it is the original grant funding mechanism for NIH and all of their other funding mechanisms, in one way or another, build on the R01, so if you get comfortable with the R01, you’re going to be able to take that knowledge and apply that any of the other funding mechanisms that you might apply to at some point. </para>
        <para id="id1169798646287">So again, that list of mandatory documents, which we’ve just gone over, I’ve highlighted research strategy, because I do want to talk about that in more depth. These are the optional documents that really aren’t necessarily optional. And then you get into the research strategy. The research plan used to be limited to 25 pages. And some people just loved this because they can go into tremendous detail when they were writing their applications. Reviewers on the other hand, because frustrated with it, because they’re very busy people, they have limited amount of time to be able to review all of these applications, they’re doing that on a volunteer effort on top of their own research and teaching and service activities, and one of the other things that NIH reviewers were beginning to notice is that the research plans were becoming bogged down with experimental details rather than telling an overall story of what the research you’re doing is going to allow us to do in the future if it is successful. What will be the ultimate impact? Will your research be a critical step in being able to identify something that will ultimately lead to the cure or treatment of a disease? Is it a component of an intervention? Those are the kinds of things that they’re more interested in, the overall significance, and also the impact of your proposal. And so what they’ve done is they have radically shortened the length of the research plan from 25 pages to 12. And what a lot of people have tried to do is take their old 25 page applications and then just cut them down to 12 pages. I would strongly recommend against that approach because what happens is you end up cutting and pasting a lot and a lot of the information is lost in the process. And the flow the proposal becomes a little bit rough, and so things that it would have been easy to </para>
        <para id="id1169798525594">follow in your 25 page research plan, are suddenly not as clear in your 12 page research plan. So I would recommend that you just start from scratch. Open up a new word document on your computer and start with a brand new application. I think then, when you have those page limitations in mind, as you write, you sort of edit yourself in terms, ‘oh, I can’t spend too much on this section because I know I still have all these other sections I have to allow room for also.’ </para>
        <para id="id4902569">The research strategy is made up of 3 specific sections. One is the introduction, one is the specific aims, and the third and most critical probably, is the research strategy. The research strategy itself is made up of another 3 components: the significance, the innovation, and the approach. Now the introduction is fortunately only used if you are resubmitting or submitting for a renewal application. If you’re submitting a brand new R01 application, you do not have to include that component. If you are submitting a, if you’re working with a resubmission or renewal application, you would have to have a introduction, and what you would do in that introduction is address the set of reviewers comments so that you can indicate to the agency, “yes, I heard what you have to say about my application, I’ve thought about it carefully, and I have revised my research program accordingly.” The other thing that that’s really nice for, if you are resubmitting your application, is that it allows you to sort of build an institutional memory for your proposal. Most times, if you submit a proposal to an agency and it’s not funded, you’ll resubmit, but you won’t have to address previous review comments, and so it’s sort of like you’ve done all of this work, and you might get, have that proposal declined again, where if they saw that you had answered all of those question, if you were right on the border, they would probably be more likely to go ahead and fund you. So those are some things to keep in mind. </para>
        <para id="id1169797338199">The Specific Aims is limited to a single page. It used to be you could have this go on for even 2 pages, now it’s strictly one page. It is considered by far the most, the single most important page in your entire proposal, and the reason for that is that it’s the one page in your proposal that everyone on your NIH study section will have an opportunity to read. Keep in mind that your reviewers are all going to be assigned, they may have let’s say 300 applications that come in for a R01, and there’s no way that they can all look at 300 applications and provide any coherent evaluations for them. So what NIH does is divide and conquer, and they’ll give 10-15 applications to one person, 10-15 more to someone else, and so forth. The primary reviewer for each application and the secondary reviewer for the application will read your application very, very carefully and they will provide, you hope, very good comments on it. The other people who are on that study section, and there maybe 20 other people on the study section have their own stack of 10 or 15 applications to review, so they’re probably not going to take on more applications than what they already got. What they would be willing to do is read a one quick page, a one summary page of the application and that way, when they’re sitting in their study section reviews and everyone’s around a big table, and they’re going through the proposals, through all of these proposals, if the primary and secondary reviewer advocate on behalf of, or not for a particular application’s funding, they can have said, “well, you know, I haven’t read the whole proposal, but I have read that one pager, and based on it, I tend to agree with the reviewer that says we should fund rather than the one that says we should decline funding.” So it’s a critically important part of the proposal. A lot of times say that reviewers essentially look at this page and make the decision on whether to fund or not just from this one page, so no pressure or anything. So it is very important. When you’re writing this, keep in mind that this needs to be a stand alone document because, again, they might not be able to read the rest of your proposal, it has to be very clearly written, and it also needs to generate some enthusiasm for your project. So you want to go beyond simply what your project is going to do and find some way to express some enthusiasm and energy when you’re discussing your project. The best way to simply do this, of course, is to talk about the ultimate impact of your project and the benefits that it might have to a larger group of people. </para>
        <para id="id1169798929578">There are a number of ways that you can write the Specific Aims section. Because this is such a critical section of the proposal, I’ve provided you with what could be considered a template for this section and it’s just a basic 5 paragraph format. </para>
        <para id="id1169799980993">In that very first paragraph, and this is a very economical approach that you take covers everything that they need to know but covers each item in about 1-2 sentences. So you have to be, I’ve worked with people before and they spend 6 weeks just on this one item. Now, they’re working on other things while they’re doing that, but they’re just continually revising and revising this section. So paragraph 1, as you would expect, is an introductory paragraph. You want to introduce the project, educate the reviewer, tell them what do we know about this project so far or about this topic or research area so far and then explain what do we not know about this research area, what’s the gap in the knowledge and why is that gap creating a problem. </para>
        <para id="id1169797291280">In the second paragraph, you’re going to show that you’re going to actually address that problem. So you would state your overall goal for the project, explain your rationale, your reasoning for actually conducting the project, and you would then present a central hypothesis, if you can. Sometimes, the individual aims for your project will be so different that it would be very, very difficult to have a central hypothesis that really covers all 3 or 4 of your aims. If that’s the case, you can simply include the hypothesis of each individual aim, when you’re discussing those aims. </para>
        <para id="id1169802984212">The third paragraph is your chance to say, “okay there’s been a problem, I’m telling you that I have a solution for it, and now I’m going to tell you about qualifications and the research environment where I work so that you will be convinced that I’m the person for this job and also that I have everything that I need to actually complete this project.” You’ve got the lab space, you have the equipment and instrumentation or access to it, you might have postdocs of graduate students who can assist you with research. Any of those things would be helpful to mention here. </para>
        <para id="id1169796475662">Another thing that people, and I’ll say a couple of things about each of these items, qualifications is a very difficult thing to write because you’re walking a very fine line between being overly humble so that your reviewers end up not really getting a full sense of what you can do or sounding almost arrogant, which you don’t want to do because obviously that’s a turn off. So what I would recommend is that you write your qualifications section and give it to a friend and have them read through it and just tell them you need really frank comments in terms of do they feel like you’re hitting the mark on what is needed here. I was working with some faculty members who were in a workshop once, and fortunately, one of the people in the workshop was very familiar with another person’s work and when we were reading the qualifications sections for this person, it was very short, and this other person piped up and said, ‘why haven’t u talked about your you know x number of patens that you’ve gotten for this?” and he has just not mentioned them. That’s a big thing to mention. So it’s a way to make sure that you’re getting everything in that really needs to be in. </para>
        <para id="id5175807">And the research environment, you can really go beyond saying, just talking about your lab and equipment and instrumentation, and you can think of this in a much broader way. So think about the intellectual environment that you’re working in. Are you at an institution where there are a number of people who are working in your area where you get to meet on a fairly regular basis or you can talk to quite often to find out, you know, get feedback on your ideas, and give them feedback on their ideas? Those are, is there are a consortium that you belong to? Is there a some kind of review group where you read each other’s publications or grant proposals? Those are things that you can mention as well, if you </para>
        <para id="id7013804">have a real rich, robust, intellectual environment. And I think anyone here within the Texas Medical Center is definitely going to have that. The research environment can also refer to your access to human subjects, so let’s say if you are working on a proposal and you’re wanting to have access to people who have a particular type of cancer because that’s what you’re going to be conducting your research on. This would obviously be an area, a city, where you would be able to find that population. Also, just the fact you live in the fourth largest city in the country is going to ensure that you’re going to have a subject pool that will allow you to recruit the people that you need for your research, and in the numbers that you need. So those are things that you can mention as well. Yes? </para>
        <para id="id1169796219434">(Question) </para>
        <para id="id1169786508097">I understand what you’re saying because there is so much that you’re trying to include in the specific aims. Yes, there is. And I would really encourage you to try to include a discussion of your qualifications and research environment in both places. It maybe that all you can do in the Specific Aims section is provide a sentence, maybe two short sentences on that, but what you’re trying to do is not simply rehash what’s already in your biographical sketch or what’s going to appear in your proposal proper. What you’re trying to do is provide the context in which the reviewers can look at your particular skills. So, you know, if you just look at a list of publications that tells you one thing, but if someone comes in and tells you their general area of expertise that suddenly makes those publications make sense. So that’s the type of thing that you would be including there. Basically, you’re priming the reviewer to look for more information in your proposal and in the biographical sketch. And to look at it in the way that you want them to look at it. </para>
        <para id="id1169803716079">Okay. The fourth and fifth paragraph of the Specific Aims, in the fourth paragraph what you will actually do is simply list your specific aims. I recommend you list them in numbered or bulleted form, and that you just have a simple sentence for each one of them. So, some of your aims might be that you’re wanting to test a certain hypothesis, create a novel design, solve a specific problem, and so forth. Be sure when you’re writing your specific aims that you focus really more on, I guess you can say the content of what it is you’re going to do, rather than the method that you’re going to do, to use. A lot of times people will say that they’re going to compare two different things and that’s their specific aim. And really, that’s not an aim. That is a methodology. That’s an approach for how they’re going to solve a problem. So what you want to ask yourself is, ‘okay, I’m going to compare these two items, but why am I comparing them? What’s the information that I hope to glean from this?’ And whatever that information is, whatever your response is, that is what your specific aim is, and then you can, of course, complete your aim by saying, “I will do this, by comparing these two groups, or these two data points, data sets, or what have you.” Does that make sense? One other thing to be very careful of when you’re writing specific aims is you want to make sure that every aim is independent. So in other words, what reviewers, when reviewers are going to give you millions of tax payer dollars, they want to make sure that you’re going to be able to complete your projects successfully. And so one of the things that they’ll look for is to make sure that every part of your project can be completed. If they see that you have to complete your first aim successfully before you can ever move on to your second aim, they’re probably going to either decline funding or seriously take off points because what their concern would be is, well if you can’t complete your first aim, the rest of your project just comes down like a house of cards. Everything sort of collapses in on itself. So what you want to do is make sure what you craft your aims in a way that, if you think of a bicycle wheel and think of your aim as the spokes on a wheel, they’re all going to the same central point that you’re trying to make in your research, but they’re not dependent one on the other. So that’s the probably most critical thing you want to think of. </para>
        <para id="id1169786508927">And then the final paragraph, you can think of this as the payoff paragraph. This is your chance to emphasize to the reviewers what the innovation and the significance of your project are. Remember innovation and significance are two of NIH’s review criteria. So you want to actually use the words “innovation” and “significance” in your specific aims and in your proposal. Don’t just assume that you can describe the significance or innovation and reviewers will immediately recognize that it is such. Remember they’re reading very quickly, often times very late at night, and so you really want to say “This project is innovative because…” and then describe the innovation. Or “This project is significant because…” and then explain the significance. I also mention impact because as you know, NIH has gone to a slightly different review formula and they have 5 review criteria, but then they also have this criteria called ‘impact’ and it’s not a specific review criteria. It’s sort of the holistic view of your entire proposal. If, however, your significance and your approach sections are weak, then chances are going to be fairly high that your overall impact score will be somewhat lower as well. One of the best predictors for success and for high reviews is the approach section. So if you get really high marks on your approach section, especially if you’ve also got them on the significance section, then chances are good you’re going to have a very high impact score as well. </para>
        <para id="id8473442">(Question) </para>
        <para id="id1169803610656">Exactly. And they, what NIH is trying to do is make a different, make a distinction between significance and impact. So significance is saying why a project is important. It’s going to help advance your field or something like that. Impact is saying why your research, what specific effect your research is going to have both short term, and long term. So it’s, significance is more of the short term view, and you can think of impact as the higher level long term view of your research. Does that make sense? </para>
        <para id="id1169790348079">(Question) </para>
        <para id="id1169802269668">Oh, because when your application is scored, they’re going to look at the 5 review criteria. One is for innovation, one for significance, one for approach, one for qualifications, and one for research resources or research environment. And they will give you a score for each one of those review criteria. But then they will also give you what’s called an impact score that’s completely separate from those. So it’s essentially them saying, “well, this is my overall impression of your proposal” so in other words, they’re not going to add up the score you get on your 5 review criteria and say, “this equals your impact score.” Those 5 things aren’t directly tied to your impact score at all. Obviously, the higher they are, the better the reviewers felt the proposal was, so the impact score is likely going to be higher. But it’s not a given. There could be times that you might have really addressed something in your proposal and it could be technically correct and everything, but for some reason reviewers just aren’t enthusiastic about the proposal, it just doesn’t grab them, and in that instance, you might have high scores for your review criteria, but an impact score that’s somewhat lower. And those are the ones that are really hard to take, so. </para>
        <para id="id1169799703995">(Question) </para>
        <para id="id1169796224987">Right, it’s going, it’s kind of strange. The priority score is a formulation that includes your review criteria as well, think it also folds the impact score in. I’m not positive about that, I'd have to double check. And then, what will happen of course is that if your priority score is above a certain level, it might be every institution within NIH sets it a different way. Some institutions will say if your application has a priority score that’s in the top 10% of applications received, you’ll get funding. Or if it’s in the top 40% of the applications that we receive, we will forward your application to the full study section review. And then </para>
        <para id="id1169799544940">you’ll get not only individual reviewer comments, but also a summary comment of exactly what was said in the room when they were reviewing your application. I’ll have to look into that. If you </para>
        <para id="id1169802906553">(Question) </para>
        <para id="id1169797703452">Right, you have the score. And one of the things. </para>
        <para id="id4877999">(I think the advisory panel has to say after… you’ll have your score that your…And they’ll publish their, other institutions don’t publish their. It’s been a little confusing) </para>
        <para id="id1169803842020">(So all the people in your study section who don’t have conflicts of interest will score it, and that will go into the priority score that impacts whether or not you receive the grant. The three people who sign your reviewer application will give you scores based on the significance and innovation and all of that stuff, okay.) </para>
        <para id="id1169804307375">(I get my comments back, and I know what they gave me, but I don’t know) </para>
        <para id="id1169789211782">And I think, also, just to build on what you’re saying. People have been asking, it used to be with the old scoring system; everybody had a pretty good idea of what kind of priority score would put you in the “fundable” range. Now that they’ve moved to the new scoring system, I think that there really just now starting to get a sense of that for each of the institutes. I don’t know if that’s sort of take on it or not, but right. </para>
        <para id="id1169799921469">Right, right, so I think it’s something that it’s worth going into the NIH webpage. And you can eventually drill down to a portion of it where they give the award data, and they’ll talk about how many applications they received, how many were funded, how many were declined and so forth. And you can start to get some of that average scores as well. And if you look at, you can look at that at an institute by institute basis. And that could allow you to start to get an idea of how close was your proposal to be funded. Sometimes it’s very, very close and they just run out of funds. I’ve worked with someone a while back and this was a while back and this was at Texas A&amp;M and they had applied to UDSA and they were actually recommended, they got excellents all across their scores, they were recommended for funding, were to be funded, and they went down the line and they funded the first 3 people who were recommended for funding, and they just didn’t have any more money. And this particular faculty member was the next one in line, and he should have been funded, but they just didn't have it. So what they told him was to reapply for the next grant cycle, which is what he did, and he was funded then. He was sort of top of the list and those kinds of things end up happening. I don't think as much with NIH as with some of the less well funded agencies like USDA, but there are those kinds of things that, where some of those top slots are taken if you want to put it that way. So </para>
        <para id="id1169799056358">(Question) </para>
        <para id="id1169801896940">Okay, so research strategy section as we mentioned is now limited to 12 pages. This is considered the heart of the proposal and people always have questions about how many pages should I devote to the three parts of the research strategy. This is a pretty good break down, significance I would give about 1-2 pages, innovation 2-2.5 pages, and your approach where you’re really talking about the nitty gritty details of your experiments, that would be 4-6 pages. One of the, one big piece of information that’s not included in one of the 3 sections is preliminary studies. You can now discuss preliminary studies in any number of ways. You can discuss it right up front and then move into the description of your proposed </para>
        <para id="id1169805385108">research. You can discuss preliminary studies as they come up, so in your approach section when you discuss aim 1, if you have preliminary studies that support aim 1 you could mention them there, or you could hold off and discuss your preliminary studies at the end. What you have to do is just look at your particular proposal and select the one that you think is going to work the best for you. That would be best for your application. And I would give that about 3 pages. </para>
        <para id="id1169803676821">If you’re a new or junior investigator and you just don’t have that many, let’s say that in your preliminary studies you don’t have a lot of publications yet, they’re going to understand that, so don’t feel like “I’ve seen my mentor’s list of publications and it goes on for 50 pages and mine is 1 page and how are reviewers going to look at that?” They’re going to be very aware of where you are in your career and they’ll gauge your publication rate or publication numbers accordingly. </para>
        <para id="id1169801962626">There’s a couple of different ways that you can organize the research strategy. I personally prefer the approach on the left, to me, that’s just more how I think where I would want to know right up front what the three aims are, and then for each aim, I would be interested in finding out the significance, the innovation, and the approach and then I would just repeat that exact same format for aim 2, aim 3, however many aims you have. There is another way to divide this up though, and that is to talk about it in terms of significance, innovation, and approach. And in that instance, you would say the significance for Aim 1, aim 2, aim 3. Then you would talk about the innovation for aim 1, aim 2, aim 3, and so forth. And again, this really depends on your particular proposal. It could be that you’re working on something where the significance for all 3 aims really melds together well, and in that instance, discussing significance and innovation and approach separately might be the way to go. I think for most people, the approach on the left is probably going to be the optimal one. </para>
        <para id="id1169802834495">We have, I want to give you a break here. I have some information here and this is very straight forward information on, that is straight from the R01 solicitation and so I think I’m just going to mention a couple of key points. On the significance, for instance, one of the things that you want to do is drive, oops, describe how the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventive interventions that drive this field, field your working in, that will be changed if your proposed aims are achieved. That is ultimately what significance comes down to. Innovation, is very similar. There’s a lot of different bullet points that they have, but essentially, what you’re doing is that you are, let’s see which one is it, if you’re describing any, I keep hitting the wrong button, sorry, a lot I guess, describing any novel theoretical concepts, approaches, methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions to be developed or used and any advantage over existing methodology, instrumentation, and interventions. I think when some people think about innovation, they think that they have to come up with an idea that’s totally brand new that no one on the planet has ever thought of before, that’s really not the case. What you may do is come up with an idea that has been floating around for a long time, but maybe you have identified a new approach, a new methodology that can be used that’s more efficient, or that's more accurate or that can be better utilized in data sets or what have you. That is still an innovation. It may not be the, sort of, game changing innovation that really changes how we think about a particular field, but it still is an innovation. So what you want to do when you’re looking at your proposal is ask yourself, what is it that I’m doing that’s different in some way than something that’s already been done? And why is my way of doing this better in some, this regard. And you can do that for any of these items that’s listed. </para>
        <para id="id1169802787000">The approach section is probably the heart. Well, it is the heart of your research strategy, this is still remember, part of that 12 pages that you’re writing and basically what you’re trying to do here is, provide the details of all of the aims that you’re going to be completing. This would mean some </para>
        <para id="id1169796750845">experimental details as well. So key things to keep in mind: I’ve done it again would be to explain how the data would be collected, analyzed, interpreted, as well as any other resource sharing plans since NIH is a publicly funded agency, any of the data that you can collect ultimately needs to be made available to other researchers. This is to ultimately save the taxpayers money from having every person have to recreate or redo experiments. </para>
        <para id="id1169799176310">One of the things that might be counter intuitive, but is very important is discussing potential problems. You might say, ‘well Phyllis, why on earth would I want to point out the problems of my research project?” You want to do that because your reviewers are going to spot them anyway. And so if you, if you know that there’s a particular part of your, let’s say experiment, where things might work, but they might not work, you want to just address that right up front in your application. Acknowledge it to your reviewers and say, “I think this is going to work and here’s why and here’s your evidence”, maybe some preliminary studies. But then you want to reassure your reviewers that if that approach doesn’t work, you have alternative methods that you can use to get the same information. It might be slower or a little bit more cumbersome, but you can still get that information. And so those are some things that you would want to include as well. </para>
        <para id="id1169801869139">If you are just starting on a brand new research project and you don’t have preliminary studies, it’s very important to go ahead and establish feasibility so that you reduce this sense of risk that your reviewers might see when they’re reading through your proposal. And then, this is not part of the research strategy proper, well it is part of the research strategy, but it’s not one of the three items that’s specifically required to be there, you just want it to be there and that’s preliminary studies. And there’s a number of ways that you can present this. One of the things that I would strongly recommend, people always ask, ‘well, how much preliminary data should I show?’ If you have conducted some preliminary studies, and the studies have already been published, the results have been published, all you have to do is provide a quick summary of the results and provide a citation so that reviewers can go and actually read the entire article if they wanted to. If you have not, if you’ve conducted preliminary studies, but you have not yet published them, there is more of a burden on you to describe what those preliminary results were and in that instance, you would have to allow more space in your actual preliminary studies section. Whenever possible, if you do have citations that are related to the proposal that you’re submitting, be sure and include those citations, because it goes just that much more toward your credibility as a researcher. </para>
        <para id="id1169797192668">And then one thing that’s especially important with preliminary studies, a lot of times it’s clear, it’s very clear in your minds how your preliminary studies related to your proposed research project. It may not be remotely clear to your reviewers, so you want to make an explicit statement of what part of your preliminary studies is actually linked to the proposed project. And sometimes it will be that, you’re going to use the data from the preliminary studies in your proposed project. Sometimes you’re going to be using a methodology that you developed in your preliminary studies on a completely different topic, but that methodology is going to be used again in your proposed study, so you want to make it explicitly clear how they’re connected. </para>

        <title>Part 3: K99 Pathway to Independence </title>
        <para id="id1169803246626">Okay, we’ll go ahead and get started. </para>
        <para id="id1169803520552">Talking now about the K99/R00 parent announcement, which is for the Pathway to Independence. This is… How many of you are grad students? How many are post-docs? If you are a graduate student, it’s not too early to start thinking about this kind of application. If you’re a post-doc, this is something that </para>
        <para id="id1169802310194">you very definitely want to think about because this particular program is only available to you up to 5 years out. So if you have more than 5 years into your postdoc, you wouldn’t be eligible. But anytime up to that, you could. And so this is something, a fantastic award. It’s very competitive, but if you get one, it not only provides good funding, but it helps to make you more competitive on the job market as well. </para>
        <para id="id1169786047278">The reason it has this split number, the K obviously represents, refers to the training component, the fellowship component. And the R refers to the research component of the project. This is really a true melded two part proposal. This is what the actual parent announcement looks like. You would access this just the exact same way you would access the parent announcement for the R01 award that we talked about earlier. </para>
        <para id="id7120982">The purpose of the Pathway to Independence Award is essentially to facilitate a very tiny transition from the postdoc stage to the Assistant Professor or Independent Scientist stage. I think some of you are probably familiar with the National Academies of Science Report that came out. They continue to update the numbers for it, but the age at which people are getting their first R01 award, which is considered the award that indicates you have independent status, that you’re an independent researcher has been steadily climbing over the years. And so, the agencies, all the federal agencies have been trying to incorporate some tactics that would allow people to start getting those R01s at a much younger age because of course if you’re, if it takes too long to get one, it hurts your chances for tenure and things like that, and so they really want to try to work with you. And that’s why they have programs like this, it’s also why now they give you an opportunity to check if you’re a new investigator because that can sometimes help give you that extra little nudge that’s needed to put you in the fundable range. So take advantage of all of these kinds of things, cause they are very, very helpful. </para>
        <para id="id1169798525860">There are two phases to the Pathway to Independence Award. The first phase is the mentored phase. The mentor support phase. It lasts 2 years. And you can, during this phase, you have to name a, as you would expect, a mentor, typically, it would be a mentor at the institution where you are currently located. You can also have more than one mentor so if there is someone else that is just a fantastic scientist that you’ve always wanted to work with, or if you’re hoping to go to a particular institution, you might try to see if you could get someone from another institution to be a mentor as well. But you want your primary mentor, in most cases, to be at your home institution, just for logistics purposes. The thing that’s really nice about this is not only can you get up to $90,000 a year, but also, you get time. That’s the big thing that this gives you. So instead of having to teach a lot of classes or run a lot of labs, you get 75% of your time guaranteed for research activities. Now the other 25% of the time, you might still be teaching or overseeing a lab, what have you, maybe some clinical work, but you don’t have to. The only thing that’s critical is that your institution guarantee that you will have 75% of your time devoted to pure research. And that really helps you get the publications that you need, that help indicate that you’re an independent scientist, and that will help you when you’re then out on the job market. </para>
        <para id="id1169796459944">What will happen then, is after phase one. After you’ve had this two years of mentored support, you then, there is a possibility, though it’s not guaranteed, that you would move onto to the independent scientist stage. Typically, here, you would be moving to another institution though you might be staying at the same institution, that is a possibility. In this instance, the amount of funds that you get goes up considerably, up to $249,000 a year. Again, you get 75% of your time devoted to research, 25% to other things. The reason this is so nice, and the reason these are so competitive is that, as a postdoc you get one of these, and you have your two years of mentored support, and during that time begin looking for a full time assistant professor position, if you’re able to tell prospective employers, ‘hey, I’m going to be bringing 3 years of support with me”, 3 times $249,000 is a pretty good chunk of change, that’s going to </para>
        <para id="id1169792588333">make you a very attractive candidate. Not that many people arrive at their first job with funding already in hand, and if you can show that you can do that, that really does increase your chances for employment. Yes? </para>
        <para id="id1169796389445">(Question – Well, the next thing, I only know this because my lab mate, they have to still give you the competitive package that every other institution gives to the people applying who don’t get this grant…) </para>
        <para id="id1169789969948">Right, right, so it’s a very sweet deal. </para>
        <para id="id1169802785754">(Question – So, for the mentor support; let’s say as part of my proposal, I want to buy a piece of equipment that’s $100,000) </para>
        <para id="id1169786332787">It has to be under $25,000, I think, if you want to keep it. Otherwise, the institution gets it. Right. </para>
        <para id="id1169797596923">Yeah, it depends. There are some, usually, there’s two different levels for equipment. It varies from agency to agency and application to application. I believe for this one it’s $5,000, normally it’s $1,000. Anything that costs - is it 5? I think it’s 5,000 – anything over 5,000 is considered equipment so a lot of the times people try to put a new computer in the equipment budget section of their, their budget section, and really, you can get a computer for under $5,000 so that would actually go into your materials and supplies if you were going to purchase a computer. Now if for some reason, you had to purchase a really heavy duty computer, and I know of a faculty member who is an archaeologist, who had to do that, who had to survive sort of, the rough and tumble of a field experience. In that instance, his computer did cost over $5,000 and it was listed in the equipment category of the budget. So </para>
        <para id="id1169801978781">(So, let’s say that my equipment costs $75,000, now, total allowed cost is $90,000, let’s say I buy my equipment now I move, can I take it?) </para>
        <para id="id4943490">There is, probably, there is a chance. You can always ask. You can try to make that part of a negotiation, and generally speaking though when I get into equipment that that’s expensive and requires that much maintenance and support from the institution, they’re going to want to keep that equipment. Because usually for really expensive equipment, what they try to do is get more than one person to be able to use that particular instrument because it would simply be, it wouldn't be feasible to provide a $75,000 instrument for every single person who needed it. So you have to share the equipment. There is though, this does come when you’re in the, actually in both stages, you have a budget for research expenses and I think it’s up to $25,000 if I’m remembering correctly. And, that is for literature support, and I don’t, I can’t remember off the top of my head what it is, but the independent scientist phase, but you would have funds available to purchase equipment. If you’re trying to purchase a very large or expensive piece of equipment, I would recommend that you actually look for equipment that you can bring because there are such things. For instance, with national science foundation, they have the major research instrumentation. NIH has the SEEPA grants, so there are ways that you can do that. Generally though, you don’t apply for a piece of equipment on your own. You have an entire group of people who would use that equipment applying together and usually you want a very large group so that they realize that you’re going to get the biggest bank for the buck out of the instrument. </para>
        <para id="id1169799698366">(So these two steps ….) </para>
        <para id="id5174907">This is actually one application that has two parts. Exactly. That’s a very good question, you do have to, when you submit this application, you will submit one application, you will have your 2 years. It’s not </para>
        <para id="id1169796847501">guaranteed that you’ll get the next 3 years, but it’s a pretty sure thing if you’ve done the work and you’ve submitted reports and all that. So right before the independent scientist phase starts, you do submit some more information. It’s not like you’re creating a new proposal though. Essentially what you’re doing is providing them with an update on what you have accomplished during the mentored support phase so that they realize that ‘okay, this is a person who’s going to make good use of this money and who’s really going to be able to accomplish some things, and therefore, we want to go ahead and fund her for the remaining 3 years.’ So it’s a much simpler process to get the last 3 years of support than it is to start off. </para>
        <para id="id1169797621463">If you get the mentor support, you’re good. So. </para>
        <para id="id1169785977248">To be eligible you have to have a research or a clinical doctorate and it has to be in hand at the time that the award would actually begin. You can’t more than 5 years of postdoc research training. You can’t have a tenure track assistant position or an equivalent research position. And US citizenship or permanent residency is not required, so this is open to everyone. One of the things that is very interesting about the Pathway to Independence Award is that the qualifications of your mentor are just as important as your own qualifications. This is when you’re probably going to, if you have been working with someone who’s got a big name in the field, that would probably be a great person to put down as a mentor. If, if that is someone that you really want to work with, and that’s going to be a critical factor as well. And someone that you feel would really provide you with good training opportunities, so that you could expand your skills and then be even better ready for independent, to be an independent scientist. </para>
        <para id="id1169802866230">(I was reading the program, and it said that one of the qualifications for the mentor is that he should have a demonstrated record of … if that is not true with our mentor, how would you?) </para>
        <para id="id1169796511550">Exactly. I would, I would think about having, if I really wanted that person as my mentor, I would think of having that person as a secondary mentor and try to find someone who does have a very, someone who’s more senior who has very well established record of having their students, and their students get positions as assistant professors. </para>
        <para id="id1169800208738">(Can we choose that person as a co-mentor; the one that’s more established as a co-mentor?) </para>
        <para id="id1169802958780">Yes, you can. </para>
        <para id="id1169799182292">(Then what kind of letter you would want from a co-mentor? What kind of paperwork?) </para>
        <para id="id1169798246284">They would want to see, what you would want to see is have both of your co-mentors write letters of reference that explain specifically what their role will be as your mentor. So it may be that one co-mentor is going to really focus on helping you with your research and this is very over simplistic, and one is going to help you with the training portion of it, where you’re learning some new skills. They would outline that in great detail in their letters, each one of them. And that way when your reviewers are reading through all your letters, they get sort of a complete package of I see that you’re going to have a very well-rounded experience through this grant. Does that make sense? The other thing is that, and this is an important point, your mentor also has to have a good track record of success, they should have some grants funded, these grants need to be federal grants. If they have NIH grants funded that would be even better. It used to be a requirement that they have NIH funding, though it’s not specifically stated in the program announcements anymore, I would definitely look for people who have NIH funding. </para>
        <para id="id4928999">So you’re probably looking at faculty members who are at the Associate to Full Professor range to be your mentor. If they’re at the assistant professor rank, they probably haven’t had time, frankly, to have mentored that many people or to have built that much of a track record for their grants. Questions? </para>
        <para id="id1169803074802">(Question – What’s the average after the submission closing to you hearing a decision? Is it a year? Or 3 years?) </para>
        <para id="id1169798413950">Forever and ever. It takes a long time. And it varies from agency to agency and program to program. Usually it’s at least 3 months minimum, probably more like 6 months. And I have seen some agencies that take 9 months. NIH has been getting much better, so I would say you would hear something within 3-6 months, and again, it would probably be closer to 3 because they’re really trying to expedite their review process.

        <para id="id8478146">(So, I guess, it looks like these deadlines. So let’s say you submit, you hear back 3 months later, it’s probably too quick of a turn around time to hit the next deadline, right?) </para>
        <para id="id6663319">It might, well, that’s actually one of the things that their trying to do, is get reviews back to people fast enough and decisions back to people fast enough that if they want to immediately incorporate those recommendations from the reviewers and reapply, they’ll be able to do that by the very next grant cycle. And that means that they would usually have to, have to get it back to you within 3 months. Since there’s about 4 months between each grant cycle. One thing that you could do is plan for an earlier grant cycle than you anticipate or that you would really want and then if you receive funding, you can negotiate with them. Let’s say you need to finish out a post doc or something, you can negotiate with them to move the start date for the project up. Or, if you had the good fortune of getting funded on the first attempt, you can go ahead and start the project if you’re staying at the same institution, and they would just start paying the cost instead of it coming out of say your advisor’s budget or something like that, if that makes sense. </para>
        <para id="id7221758">(So, for the mentor, are they expected to write in their letters how many postdocs they have mentored?) </para>
        <para id="id1169791143450">No, they don’t have to do that, they don’t have to say that explicitly, but I think they will actually include a biographical sketch in the proposal just like you will and it is generally going to be clear, just from their publication record and from their grant support whether or not they have mentored a number of students. If someone has a lot of grant support it’s almost a given that they’re going to have a lot of students working in their labs so that’s one thing. It could that your mentor might say something to the effect of “I have mentored X amount of students over the years and this particular student is one of the top 3.” They might make a statement like that, which suggests how many they’ve mentored, but it’s not a requirement that they include that. </para>
        <para id="id1169802225101">In the Pathway to Independence Award, as you’ll see, all of these documents look very, very similar. They are exactly the same kind of documents that you would need for the R01 project research grant, or research project grant except for the last very one on the list. And that is the “Career Development Award Supplement Form.” This contains a, quite a bit of information, as you can see, this is what the form looks like, it’s actually 2 pages, but the first page has you provide information, an introduction to the application, there’s then a very large section that's focused on candidate information. And let me look, I can give you page numbers for this as well. So you have a total of 12 pages to discuss all of the </para>
        <para id="id1169797096376">candidate information. In with that will be the candidate background, I have this written out so you can see it more clearly. The candidate’s background, your career goals and objectives, the career development and training activities, so will you be attending formal classes? Will you be attending informal seminars? Will you be getting one-on-one training with someone? What kinds of training and development work will you be getting? And also your research strategy. You will work with your mentor on all of these sections, but especially on the Career Development and Training Activities, and the Research Strategy, because it’s really going to be you talking with your mentor and saying, ‘you know, I really want to get more expertise in this area,’ and your mentor would then help establish a training program for you that helped you grow in that area. Similarly, if you’re writing the Research Strategy, you want someone who’s very senior, like your mentor would be, to review that research strategy or perhaps even help you write that Research Strategy so that it’s as competitive as possible. What you’re aiming for in your Research Strategy is to indicate to reviewers that you have what it takes to become an independent scientist, and that’s why you would want to work with, ironically, why you would want to work with someone, a mentor, is to make sure that you’ve got your project set up so that once you’re done not only with the mentored phase, but also the research scientist phase, you can truly branch out on your own and begin doing research without having to have input from a mentor or from other people. You will always have input from other people because that’s just what’s required when research is as complicated as it is now, and as interdisciplinary as it is. But in theory, you wouldn’t have to have that. </para>
        <para id="id1169788893358">You also, the training and responsible conduct of research is a very critical issue. I know that at Rice the program is through, it’s the CITI program, C I T I, and there’s a number of different modules that are available on this topic that people can take and it provides a score and once you pass you’re good to go. So you would just describe what those modules would be, that’s one page. The mentoring plan is written primarily by the mentor and it’s 6 pages long, obviously there will be input. You would have statements of support from the mentors, this would be the letters, and so you would just want to make sure that all of the letters combined weren’t over 6 pages so that you could fit all of those in. And then you also want to show how your institution is committed to you as a candidate. One of the key things that this means for the mentored phase of this award is that they will guarantee that you will have 75% of your time free to conduct research, that they’re not going to try to drop classes on top of you or labs on top of you, things like that and still expect you to do all of this research. So you would get a letter of commitment, typically from your department chair. Yes? </para>

One of the things that they point out in the solicitations, is that if you’re going to do clinical work and you’re applying for one of these, be sure, you should always contact your program manager, that be sure to do that if you’re conducting clinical research, because it’ll make sure, they’ll make sure there’s a few things that have to be set up in special ways, and they’ll make sure that you have everything set up properly for your application, and they’ll make sure that you’ll still qualify for it. </para>

Others can’t apply to them, it’s just clinical, and they have those at all stages of career development so I would recommend that you look through some of those, and that you might have a better shot, it sounds like if this is the particular organization that you’re going to be targeting, and they’re being a little discouraging. I would probably say, go ahead and look for another funding application, but I would talk to them about it first because you never know and you want to have as many opportunities as you can. </para>

        <para id="id1169796578842">Correct. In NSF you typically have to have either permanent residency or US citizenship. And that is going to be true on most of the awards that are for fellowships or for training opportunities because what the United States is trying to do is develop some of its own researchers who will stay here and really help build up our sciences because often times we’re really lacking in the sciences. And so, in terms of having had a NIH, a NSF support before you apply for this NIH award, that’s not necessary. At all. So you don’t have to have any other kind of research. </para>

        <para id="id1169797924272">Right, that will be something that’s factored into the way they review the applications and a lot of it will depend on what people have made of the NSF fellowship. Some people are very productive and they’ve gotten a lot of publications from it, some people have sort of done the minimal and they really haven’t gotten that much out of it. And if they haven’t done that much, that might, having had it and not done, having done as much with it, might actually count more against them than if you had never had it at all and you had managed to still be productive so yes, you don’t, you’re not required to have any prior funding at all when you apply for this. Obviously, if you have, that’s great and even if it’s internal funding or from other agencies or private foundations or corporations, I would list it all, but you don’t have to have a big federal award before you apply for this. </para>

And same thing goes with the research, so you’ll really be working really closely.

This could be a situation though, where you would talk to a program manager and explain your situation and say, you know, would it be possible to do this, or would this require that I have a second year of the post-doc? I’m guessing that they’ll going to either require or encourage you to take that second year because the whole point of the mentored phase is to get you new skills, and so if you suddenly said, well, I’m just going to get one year of that instead of 2 years of that, they may say, we’re making a really big investment, and you’re not getting as much out of it as you could if you had the full two years.

I would probably start with the aims for my research, make very clear what those are, and then I would probably include the aim for the career development so that I could come in and make a statement along the lines of ‘these career development activities will thoroughly prepare me to conduct the research’ and describe the effects. </para>

So yes, it will be seen, but they should support one another as you’re talking, so you shouldn’t have to, when you’re describing your career development stage, you shouldn’t have to completely start over in describing what your research is that you’ve already discussed in the previous sections.

        <para id="id1169791996227">Right, it’s not, and think in terms of the career development as it’s not a single feat, so career development can encompass formal classes that you might be taking. It could encompass going to specific conferences so that you can have a chance to interact, to network with other people in your field. It could be taking online courses, it could be working with a journal club, it could be working with a group of your peers who meet on a regular basis and maybe it’s an affinity group where you’re all interested in similar topics, so there’s a lot of things that can be pulled into your career development plan, so what you can do is, and I say have at least one aim per career development, two different aims. There might be one that’s focused on one aspect, major aspect of career development, and another one that focuses on others. So maybe one aim is focused on formal didactic training, and the second aim is focused on more informal training that’s just as important. It’s just less. </para>

Exactly, it may be that because of judicial reasons, you want to try to set it up so that maybe one or two of your aims naturally finish at the end of two years simply because there are issues of intellectual opportunity and who owns the data that’s been collected, so you want to make sure you have access to all of that data when you move to a different institution. So in that instance, or if there’s certain equipment where you work now but you might not have in the next institution that you’re at and so those are some things you would want to take into account, but primarily you can look at this for the long haul because that’s really what it’s meant to be.

        <para id="id8210126">That’s a very good point to make. There is a mentored phase and obviously your mentor is probably someone who you’ve worked with a lot. And so they have had a great influence on you and most likely. If you work with them on this proposal for the mentored phase, they will continue to have that influence, but what you want to demonstrate is, and I would make it very explicit statement that by the time I have completed this 2 year mentored phase, I will have all of the skills necessary to become an independent scientist. I would just flat out say it, so there’s no doubt about it whatsoever. And what you will do, is emphasize that during that mentored phase, there’s definitely a skill set that you want to get in terms of maybe conducting certain types of experiments or learning to use equipment that you haven’t had an opportunity to use yet, those kinds of things that you would do dependent on a mentor for at this phase. You can say, well, once I’ve gone through this mentor phase, he or she, my mentor, is going to have taught me all of these things, and I’ll be able to go off on my own. Does that make sense? So it’s good, it’s very artificial, to me it’s a very artificial distinction or boundary between a mentor and an independent scientist. There is a phase when you are compiling influence by your mentor, and there is a phase where you’re clearly beginning to branch out on your own and begin to look at questions that aren’t necessarily related to what your mentor was saying in his or her lab. At the same time, research is so interdisciplinary now that you’re always going to working with people that may not be formal mentors, but they’re still going to be providing you with new knowledge, new information, just as you will for them. So to me, it’s kind of a fuzzy line, but I think that’s the way that you would do it, is just show, these are the specific things that I need, if my ultimate goal is to this kind of research, and I have skills that get me to this point, I need to get the skills, the additional skills that move me to that next point, and I’ll get those in these 2 years, and once I have that, I’ll be able to branch out and begin my own sort of. </para>

Because the people who are going to be reviewing are going to be fairly established themselves and so they will be able to see that. They’ll also be looking at the publications list and grant support list and things like that for both you and your mentor or your mentors. And that will give them a good idea as well. One thing that you can do is that when you’re planning the research portion of this project, think in terms of coming up with a project that is somewhat different from what your mentor is currently working on in the lab. Maybe it’s something that’s slightly related, so that they would still have the ability to mentor you, obviously, that you might want to think in terms of making it clear that you’re about to go in a slightly different direction. It doesn’t have to be opposite direction, they realize that people are going to be very, when you get to this stage, you’re at a focused, more narrow area of research, but that’s how I would do that. </para>

Would I be able to find all of the ways that I’ve met the review criteria?’ so those are some good ways to approach it. </para>

You don’t want someone to write a rushed reference letter for you for a proposal that is as competitive as this one is. </para>

One of the comments that people get, I think almost, I think that is very common on their first application especially, they’ll get a review comment that’s saying that they have been overly ambitious and that’s in some ways not a bad thing, it means that you are a real go getter and that you have lots of ideas and lots of energy, and you’re ready to go forth and conquer. And so that’s great. What is not so great about it is, is that you have to remember that you have a limited amount of time, a limited amount of money, and other resources available to complete all of that work. And so, very likely, remember you don’t have to do your entire career’s research under a single grant. You’re going to have plenty of other opportunities to get grants, to continue to build on the research that you start, so the key thing is just to try to be realistic. And this is where having a mentor or colleague who’s fairly senior take a look at your aims and make sure that they do appear to be doable within the timeframe. </para>
        <para id="id1169794113147">You also want to explicitly state that you have all the resources that you need.

You’re not trying to write down to your reviewers by any stretch of the imagination, but you do want to write clearly. A lot of times people will assume that their reviewers are going to have the same level of really deep knowledge of their topic as they have, and the reality is you’re probably the expert on that topic or one of the few experts on that topic. And so you want to make sure that your reviewers will be able to truly understand what it is that you’re trying to describe. You can do that in a number of different ways. I think, probably, the best, is just simply to make sure that your describing things in clear terms. Don’t try to make things more complicated, sometimes I think, when people write, they almost try to make things sound complicated, and trust me, the research that all of you are doing is complicated enough, you don’t need to try to make it sound complicated. If you can make it sound very accessible, your reviewers will love it. Because they’ll be able to read through, and first of all, and understand what you’re saying, which benefits you greatly. And secondly, if </para>
        <para id="id1169789498357">they read through and understanding everything, in the back of their minds, they’re thinking ‘dang, I’m smart, I’m able to follow this, and it’s not even in my immediate field’ and that’s always a good thing to have your reviewers feel this way. To have, a kind of, positive, I guess, a positive experience in reading your proposal. One of the things that I have heard said about proposals, the way that you know you have a really good proposal, is if at the end of reading it, you feel like you have learned something. So that might be one way to think of proposals when you’re beginning to write is would somebody feel like they really learned something new or gained some new insight from reading this proposal? </para>
        <para id="id1169786332251">You also want to make sure that your application is complete. This is one of the reasons that you want to start early and try to begin uploading everything early so that if you see that there is, you might suddenly discover that there is a form that needed to be filled out that you just didn’t make it to. This would give you time, if you didn’t have that, to go ahead and create it or fill out the form or what have you. Make sure that you have zero tolerance for typos. I know a lot of times people will say, oh it’s the content that’s important, it’s not the superficial things like typos, but it is the superficial things like typos because what the typos tell you about the person’s care that they might be taking with their data, so they’ll be making inferences that you might not necessarily think about when their reading your proposal. So you want that proposal to be as clean as possible so that they realize or make an assumption that your data is equally high quality. </para>
        <para id="id1169799118173">You want to, for NIH especially, relate the potential impact on research and how NIH’s fundamental mission is to improve public health, whether it’s through diagnosis, treatment, interventions, cures, what have you, you want to very clearly hit how what you’re doing is going to help public health. It may be that it’s going to be a step in a very long series of steps that are required to help public health, it may be that you’re developing an intervention that would be immediately useful. Either way, you want to connect your research to improve public health. </para>
        <para id="id1169802945183">And then also you want to think like a reviewer. And as I said earlier, when you’ve completed your application, read through it, ask yourself is what I have written clear? Have I told the story of the research? Is this written more as a narrative so that, we all love stories where people tell stories, it’s what we do, and so, you want to ask yourself at the end of this, have I told a compelling story to my reviewers and have I supported it with good evidence along the way? And then, if you’ve done that, ask yourself, ‘now, okay, if I were to review my own application, how would I score it?’ so go through and ask yourself ‘what would I give myself for this significance criteria? How would I rate the approach criteria?’ and so forth. And if you see that one of those scores tends to be, you might rate it a little bit lower, don’t despair, this is good that you’ve identified it, and much better you’ve identified it than the reviewer. So you can go back and in and shore that part of your proposal up. You might need to get more feedback, for instance. And in that way, you can feel much more confident when you submit your application that you’ve got a truly excellent application because that is really the case. </para>
        <para id="id7175918">Are there any questions? I apologize for going so far over, but I think that we had really good questions along the way, and I’m glad that we have a lot of time to answer those. Are there any last minute questions? </para>
        <para id="id1169802502682">If you have questions later, please feel free to e-mail me. I’m at Rice University, in the Office of Proposal Development, and I don’t think, I can give you my e-mail address. And good luck on all of your research.</para>
