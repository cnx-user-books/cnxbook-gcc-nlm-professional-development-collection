    <para id="id1171498821258">Instructor (Sujata Krishna):</para>
    <para id="id1171493982457">
      <emphasis effect="italics">Now I want to introduce the overall program under which this workshop is being held.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171493523348">
      <emphasis effect="italics">You’re all welcome to the Gulf Coast Consortia, where this is the NLM professional development. We’re forming a course and this is one element of the course. So we’ve had several workshops and there are several more to come in May and some in June, so keep your eyes open.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171493531694">
      <emphasis effect="italics">The course is actually for biomedical informatics graduate students, but we have left it open in this pilot here to any graduate students. </emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171493511189">
      <emphasis effect="italics">And the GCC serves 6 institutions, Rice is one of them. U of H, Baylor, MD Anderson, UTMB and U of H. So you may find people here from different institutions, please get to know each other. That’s one thing that we really encourage you to do, to network here.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171494087032">
      <emphasis effect="italics">And now I would like to introduce the topic. We’re going to talk about conflict resolution. And we have a second hour, after Mikki speaks, which is open to all of you. You can ask questions for personal or professional development. So this will be anything, from “how do I get a job?”, “am I suited to this?”, whatever. And if she’s not willing to take it, she’ll say so, I guess. So please, please use that.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171494974793">
      <emphasis effect="italics">She’s a professor of management and psychology. She has a background as an applied psychologist. So she is eminently capable of talking on this topic. And another thing you should know about her is she’s big on running. She’s done several marathons. I think she’s done 52. So great, another marathon session here.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171493533130">Mikki Hebl: </para>
    <para id="id1171502136196">So welcome, everyone. </para>
    <para id="id1171494004525">So I’m pleased to be here. Just to give you a little bit more about me. I am from the great state of Wisconsin. I also spent time in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and California and Texas, okay, so I feel like I’ve been around. I was trained in Social Psychology. My social psychology, for those of you who don’t know, is the study of the way people think about, influence, and interact with others. So it’s really the social </para>
    <para id="id1171497860822">psychology is the study of our daily lives. I got hired in an I/O Industrial Organization program, which was really fitting with my interest because I/O psychology is the psychology of the workplace. So if you think of social psychology as the psychology of daily social interactions. It’s easy to take that and look at it in the workplace. </para>
    <para id="id1171495685002">There are courses on conflict resolution within I/O psychology, within social psychology. So I was thinking about what to teach you, and how to broach this subject, and I thought ‘man, there’s so much to teach.’ So I just put a few overheads up there as guiding points of things I’d like to cover. We can get more specific. Please interrupt me if you have questions.</para>
    <para id="id1171493380942">And what I would say a lot about the stuff that I’m going to talk about is what I always tell my graduate students, which is the answer to “How do you? What do you? When should I? Should I?” is “It depends.” Okay? See? A+ in the course.</para>
    <para id="id1171493373987">It depends, okay? It depends. So for conflict resolution, it also depends. It depends on so many things. </para>
    <para id="id1171494121639">So I study social interactions and you can ask, say you’re interested in “Should I confront the conflict?” Well, it depends. It depends because we want to look at the situation that you’re in: How much power do you have? Will it hurt? Could it potentially hurt you? We want to look at the situation in which the person you are having the conflict with is in: Is this person a superordinate to you? Is this person controlling your destiny? What are the personalities characteristics of this individual? Does this person have sort of a “my way or the highway” because it doesn’t matter how good you are at conflict resolution if this person is “this is the way,” you’re really going to be wasting your time, and possibly hurting your time by digging deeper. Okay?</para>
    <para id="id7416238">And then you can think about the situation itself. So you have: you, you have the other person, and you have the situation. And some situations are ripe for solving. If we come to an impasse, and we cannot move, we’ve got to talk. We’ve got to get around the conflict, but there are some conflicts that really are best just kind of left alone. Watched, and left alone. You feel it’s there. The other person feels it’s there, but sometimes to bring it out into the open is possibly the worst thing to do. Okay? So it really does depend. And also, I can’t give you a situation where say, in this situation with this person or that person, this is the best thing to do. Because it may be the best thing today, but tomorrow it may be the worst thing, okay? So even within person, there … it depends. It depends. What’s going to come out of your mouth when you confront that, okay? Is it okay to be articulate? Is it as articulate today as it was yesterday? Are you going to say exactly what you said to me when we practice it? And what, did so and so take his or her medicine today? Is it going to be well received? So to some of this, to a large extent, some of the things I tell you is going to be “it depends.”</para>
    <para id="id1171494329201">Now, I want to tell you that when I was a graduate student. Actually, that’s not true. When I was an assistant, a visiting assistant professor at Dartmouth College. So I got my Ph.D. at Dartmouth College, and then I stayed there one additional year. So I was a visiting assistant professor. And just like Rice has this opportunity to be a resident in the dorms, I had the opportunity to be a resident in the dorms. So I lived in the dorms with the students for one year. And in order to do this, I had to take a lot of different training classes, because if you live in the dorms, you’re going to be experience a lot of crises, conflicts, illegal stuff, okay? And you’re somewhere between a blind parent, you’re not supposed to be parenting them, to a very responsible police officer. You are supposed to prevent deaths, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171495686654">So, I dealt with a lot of issues. And one of the things, that I would say is probably the most meaningful conflict related training that I got, or even better than exposure to a lot of the readings, was I went to mediation training. And it was only a 3-day course, and they have courses in mediation training that are many, many hours. You have to do a certain number of hours, and then you can call yourself a mediator. And if you are a mediator, I think you can get licensed, and you can practice this. And what I will say is those 3 days have helped me with my own personal relationships, with trying to solve conflicts, and I just recently did this in our department between faculty members, and it helps just solving and listening to other peoples’ problems. So I would like to tell you a little about that today. And I would say, if there is ever was a chance that you get to take mediation training, do it. It is not a waste of time, okay? It’s just.</para>
    <para id="id1171493418356">Yes, go ahead. </para>
    <para id="id1171493419993">(inaudiable question)</para>
    <para id="id1171494052353">There’s not among this course, but if you look in my guess, my guess is if you look in Houston at mediation training, you would be able to find it. It’s offered. I had a guy who was selling me my condo 5 years ago, and he said that he was a mediator on the side, and many people who are lawyers get mediation training. It is, it’s a job in of itself, but there is such a thing as just getting mediator training, so that you can help in crises. So I just google “mediation training in Houston” and you should be able to see it. And again, it was provided at Dartmouth, so it may be provided at University of Houston. I don’t think it’s provided, to my knowledge, at Rice. But I would look at the other schools. And I know at Dartmouth, if you got 90 hours, you were certified, or something like that. That goes back on my memory to a while ago, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171493420332">(inaudible question)</para>
    <para id="id1171494816902">There’s not mediation training, but there may be something on conflict resolution. I don’t know if there is. Do any of you know? Certainly, there are in many business schools. So you could again, if this is of interest to you, but I think they take more of a conflict resolution between stake holders; whereas, this is, this translates. I mean if </para>
    <para id="id1171494964659">you’re going to see, I put how to try to resolve a conflict between you and another individual. How to do it with your advisor, and how to do it with your department head, those sorts of things. And what you see is the same strings run through. But I’m just telling you: please, look for it because it is not a waste of time. I’ve used it in my marriage, I’ve used it in friendships, and I definitely used it to get people together to talk about the issues and try to be transparent and try to be get beyond it, okay? Yes.</para>
    <para id="id1171509008129">
      <emphasis effect="italics">as you grow older, it difficult to change habits, yourself and the way you think. And I wondering if by taking mediation training, this lecture, or similar lectures at Rice. How easy is it to assimilate yourself and modify your behavior?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171501847816">That’s a great question; and everyone heard that, right? And can you, do you hear that on the tape too? So, we social psychologists, and psychologists in general, and personality, and we study this. Do people change behaviors? Do heavy people lose weight? Do people who are smokers stop smoking? Do who are mean, are they always mean? And the answer is that a lot of behaviors, habits, personality dispositions become more and more fixed, and they say that Todd Heatherton and his colleague, Roy Bowmeister, wrote a book about ‘do personalities change’, and their answer was no, not after 32. So you have until 32 to get it right, and then you’re screwed. And I don’t think that’s quite right. I think his point is that it is very difficult to change behaviors. It is very difficult. Do people do it? Absolutely, because they follow this book up with micro-narrative approaches of how people are successful. How there are Jareds out there, like the Subway eater who lost all his weight. How people do stop smoking, how people do change dramatically. They were butt-heads, and they’re really nice people. They’re philanthropist, or whatever. But it is hard; it’s hard for people to change. </para>
    <para id="id1171494073114">With mediation training, I don’t know that you have to change your personality or to something that severe, I think it’s a way of following steps so that you hear the other person. And the steps of mediation make it so that you have to follow these steps and once you follow these steps, it’s not really about changing your personality. It’s about suspending your anger and suspending your beliefs to listen and articulate what the other person says and have them listen and articulate what you say so that you can find out if there is some common ground and usually there is. Usually what is the problem with conflict is that people lose the ability to argue over the objective truth and facts, and they start going to name-calling, insults, and defenses. And so they lose the ability to solve “is this room white? Or is it off-white?” Okay? Instead of “I told you! And you always say that I’m wrong, and I’m not wrong, and look at it! It looks just ..” and so people begin to argue about things that aren’t the topic of the conflict. And so mediation training is often about getting rid of all of those trait level things and just focusing in on this one particular incident and setting some ground rules so that it’s less likely to invoke all of that extra stuff that we have, our personalities and things that aren’t likely to budge. Does that make sense? And we’ll take more about that, as well. And please feel free to interrupt me.</para>
    <para id="id1171496134257">So, let’s move on. So, anyways. So I’m going to talk about conflict resolution and then I’m just going to have open forum for professional issues, discussions. I teach “Professional Issues”. I’ve taught it about 7 or 8 times, I taught it to both at both of you, 2 of the students, and I need to teach it to two more of the students here. So no telling, this is a preview. And I love this stuff, and I feel very free to talk about all sorts of things, and I’ll give you some references at the end that I think are particularly good spots that you should know about because the references and resources are out there, and the web has never been a more helpful source of advice, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171506333763">So conflict, here we go.</para>
    <para id="id1171505655934">Conflict: to come into collision or disagreement; be contradictory, at variance, in opposition, clash. The account of one eye-witness conflicted with that of the other. My class conflicts with my going to the concert. To fight or contend; do battle. A fight, battle or struggle; especially a prolonged struggle. Strife; controversy; quarrel. Conflicts between parties, discord of action, feeling or effect. Antagonism or opposition, as of interest or principles. A conflict of ideas. </para>
    <para id="id1171493325676"/>
    <para id="id1171493494482">So you hear this and when I was reviewing this, and you might be doing this too, you might say, “Ah… isn’t academics one big conflict? Isn’t the whole purpose of academics, to sort of say, ‘no.. it’s not’s quite what they said, it’s actually this’ or ‘so and so 1999 was wrong, it’s this’ and then so and so 1999 write back and say ‘people! 2011 was completely wrong!’ so this is about, we keep each other business because of conflict. So to some extent, in academia, and in the workplace and in general, creativity comes out of conflict, new ways of thinking comes out of conflict. Conflict isn’t always seen as such a bad thing. And there are also not only subcultural differences, but there are cultural differences in how we feel about conflict as well. But I would say, that when we think about conflict, what we think about are some of the negatives, so we think about voices being raised, we think about people pointing their fingers, okay? “You did this to me!” okay? “You!” and of course, we are always reminded that four fingers are pointing back at us, okay? People insult each other so we move from, “you know, you didn’t clean up the dishes” to “you know what? You never help. You’re just lazy. You’re lazy.” Okay? So we quickly move into insulting each other and away from the topic. We get defensiveness. “I know what you’re going to say, but let me just tell you why you’re wrong.” Relinquishing positions, so often times, in a conflict, if we have to give up, if we have to relinquish our position, we’re seen as weak, okay? So we’re seen as “you know what? This is how I feel and this is what I want and this is it. Okay? It’s a zero-sum game, I want it all, you get none.” And if we relinquish at all, it sometimes feels in our society, like we have failed. Like we haven’t gotten what we wanted. </para>
    <para id="id1171502977395">The subjectivity of it. So when we see conflict, again, what happens, is we often lose the ability to be just completely objective and know the facts and learn the facts. What we want to do is look at the facts with experimenter bias. We want to say, “Well… you could say I’m right in that situation if you …” okay? So you make it so that you’re coming out ahead. People use emotion over logic. My colleague studies the way people </para>
    <para id="id1171495620096">approach situations. Do you approach situations with cognizance or do you approach them with emotions? So if somebody insults you, “You know what? I really don’t like your glasses.” Okay? Do you say, “Oh... you know, maybe these glasses aren’t the best.” Or do you go, “Well, I don’t like your nose.” Okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171495622674">You know? And we have different ways of reacting, and those are not state level. They are trait level. Okay? And that’s what he shows. There’s sort of, there’s a way that we are more likely to react in this sort of emotional “whoa blah blah blah” or a cognitive. </para>
    <para id="id1171504808293">There are situations in which all of us tend to be more cognitive, and situations in which all of us tend to be more emotional. We lose sight of the facts and we use ‘you’ statements that personalize the issue. So instead of, “you know, I would have liked the dishes to have been done,” its “you never do the dishes, you lazy son of a gun.” Okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493419635">So is conflict good? Some of it is good, it’s often part of the growing experience. And it’s good because we have dissonance. If you know about cognitive dissonance, it often feels uncomfortable to have that conflict, so it propels us into action, and that’s a good thing. So conflict, if we come away from this talk thinking conflict is really bad, this is not true. Conflict is a part of our society, it is a part of your life, and it probably will always be a part of your life. So the best thing we can do is think about how we can frame conflict and move it from a necessarily bad thing into something that’s good and be sure that we have the tools that when we want to get out of conflict, we can get out of it. So some of it is bad. Conflict, when it is very extreme can be the precursor to major stress and depression, inability to perform well, preoccupation with situations or with other people. </para>
    <para id="id1171497697735">And I see I’ve lost one slide. And maybe I just erased it, but I was going to say was there is a quote by, maybe I lost it, let’s just see if it’s here. I must have erased it, but anyways. It basically says that in academics, we work with conflict; our subject matter is conflict and there is a quote by Duey(?). Do I have it on here? I don’t have it on here. But basically, Duey(?) is a psychologist who basically says conflict is good, it breeds thought, and it breeds us into action. So just to say conflict is sometimes good, it’s sometimes bad in extreme.</para>
    <para id="id1171493419659">I’d like to have you focus on Chinese symbol on the bottom left. So is anyone in this room, does anyone in the room know how to read that symbol? No? Yes? What is it? What is it? </para>
    <para id="id1171493419677">It’s conflict. Tang tu? </para>
    <para id="id1171493419685">(inaudible students)</para>
    <para id="id1171493419689">Okay. And so, this is, tell me, you get to tell me because I looked this up, and it means “danger” or “chance,” okay. Okay, which one is the danger one? The whole? </para>
    <para id="id1171505810476"/>
    <para id="id1171493344688">
      <emphasis effect="italics">(Student: yeah, it means trouble)</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171493506582">So what I read on the internet, also, but I don’t speak Chinese, is also that there is opportunity within it too? <emphasis effect="italics">(Student: No, second word has meaning of opportunity)</emphasis></para>
    <para id="id1171498423686">But together this makes conflict. </para>
    <para id="id1171504951388">
      <emphasis effect="italics">(Student: The Chinese word… this is danger)</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="id1171493530899">So this is a bit different with the other one. So we have to stick with this one.</para>
    <para id="id1171493507114">So this is the one I was going for, and what I’ve learned is that this signal, this symbol for conflict means both “opportunity.” It’s defined as “opportunity” and “danger” together. Is that true? The second one. You say it’s the opposite. Well, whatever it is, what I learned was that the Chinese symbol for conflict involves both “opportunity” and “danger” and I think, if we stick with that, maybe I didn’t get my symbols right, if we stick with that, I think that’s a really good way of thinking. That’s a good way of thinking about conflict. Okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171501885132">And so Lazourous (?) developed and researched a model to helping individuals react to conflict. And this has continued to be a pronounced theory in psychology. Jim Blaskovitz(?) and his researchers at Santa Barbara, CA do research on this as well. And they look at what happens when people view something as a threat vs. a challenge. And if they view it as a threat, people tend to use wishful thinking, avoidance, and even hostility and aggression as a coping strategy.</para>
    <para id="id1171494823320">So if you view something as a threat, you want to stay away from it, you remove yourself from it. If you view it as a challenge, then you’re more likely to find solutions and thoughtful action as a result of this perception. So I view it as a challenge, I’m going to move toward it, I’m going to try to overcome it, I’m going to try to see something good in it. And again, I think when we have a confrontation, one of the things that I would like you to leave with, is the idea that you can view it as something that’s a threat or you can view it as this is something in my life that is creating cognitive dissonance that I have to solve, that I have to move beyond, and I should move toward it, okay? So Chinese character for conflict is pictured here, and it means danger and chance. So if you not only see the threat and danger in the conflict, what challenge or chance do you see? </para>
    <para id="id1171495616933">And I’d like all of you to just choose a conflict in your life. Okay, whatever that conflict is. Maybe it’s a conflict within yourself. Maybe it’s a conflict with another person, maybe it’s a longseeded conflict, whatever that conflict is, and raise your hand once you have that conflict. I won’t make you tell me about it, but I just want to know that we’re all thinking of a conflict.</para>
    <para id="id1171493419729">I want you to think in your mind of a conflict that you have, right now, with another person. Sometimes people have conflicts within their own self, “Oh I want to do this” “No I really, really want to do this” “I should to this…” “I should work on my dissertation, No I should not”, I know, I’m mind reading over you. She channeled her thoughts to me and they reached me, okay? But some of you might have a person that you really just are having frustrations with. Maybe it’s an advisor, maybe it’s somebody else. And once you have that conflict, just raise your hand. If you don’t raise your hand, I’m going to give you an extra conflict of mine. Do you have a conflict too?</para>
    <para id="id1171508282576"/>
    <para id="id1171497148100">No? Well, I do. Do you have a conflict? No, behind you. Okay, okay, that’s fine. </para>
    <para id="id1171498458212">So we all have a conflict, and I want you to just think about that conflict right now, and tell me, do you have negative feelings about it? Okay, is it unresolved? Okay, so are there ways that you could look at it as a positive thing? Can you remove the negative things and say, “This could propel me into action, maybe I really need to do something about it.” Now, some of the “propel into action” will become clear because you simply continues to be with you. If you can say “uh… I have this conflict, and you know what? It’s just dull, it doesn’t bother me that much, it’s just sort of a nuisance, I can let it rest.” But if I can say to you, ‘do you have a conflict?’, and right away, “OH YEAH! I GOT MINE” and it’s welling up inside of you, then maybe that’s one you want to think about and really use in this thing. And I want to have you do this exercise of having that conflict and thinking about the conflict, because at the end, I’d like to propel you into action with the skills to possibility to overcome it. </para>
    <para id="id1171505101838">If you get fired, you’re a graduate student or a post-doc, I am not held accountable. Okay? So I have no additional funding to take you on in my lab. She says, “No I, no you don’t.” We’ll at least help you work through some of it, alright? Okay.</para>
    <para id="id1171494991369">I teach this in my graduate class, here’s this orange. So two people were arguing over an orange and both felt they should have it, a third person deciding to settle the argument cut the orange in half, and gave half to each of the two people. However, neither were happy. The first person needed orange juice, the second person needed the zest from the orange peel. To me, this illustrates the first, most important step in conflict resolution, and that is: We need to understand, and listen to each other, okay? Both of these individuals who wanted the orange could have had 100% what they wanted if they had just talked about what they wanted, listened to each other, and resolved it, okay? Now, do all conflicts result in this possibility? No. In some possibilities, you’re going to get half an orange, and that’s it. And then you’re going to have the cake, or you’re going to </para>
    <para id="id1171501918341">have less orange juice – a little bit of water, okay? But, there are situations in which people can really come to a 100% satisfaction with each other, and you want to think about what does it mean to resolve conflict.</para>
    <para id="id1171504672510">Does it mean that one person gets 100, the other person gets 0? Does it mean that everyone gets 50% so that you’re never really happy? And again, that’s something you want to talk about when you think about other alternatives, when you think about all the options that you can do. So, one of the main takeaway points is, you need to accurately identify the problem and when you do this, it usually involves listening. You have to identify, what is the problem that you have, what is the problem that other people see, you got to take in information, okay? If this is a really big conflict, it helps not only for you to address what you see as the problem, what you see the other person sees as the problem, and what 3<sup>rd</sup> party sees. So you’re collecting lots of data, right? We’re all researchers. So you collect lots of data because a lot of times when you collect data from your friends, they might say, “Listen, Micky, I really, I think you’re really reasonable in general, but on this situation, I don’t think you’re quite right, and here’s why” and it’s much easier for you to listen to a friend and to lose a face with your friend, than it is if you’re being unreasonable in the confrontation and dispute. So it’s good to collect information, “Here’s the scenario. What do you think about the scenario? Ask somebody trusted.” And the thing is, there’s a lot of pressure when you’re asking this trusted friend for them to say, “Oh, I think exactly what you think, okay?” So you say, “No, I need your advice, I really need you to give me feedback here.” So again, collecting information and making sure you identify the situation properly. Know what’s going on. Be a fact finder. It’s really important.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420476">So here’s my last, my second, I had this written down so I’m hoping that this is correct, okay?. But this accurately identifying the problem, and this is the verb “to listen.” Does that look like “to listen” to you? And it involves ears, eyes, undivided attention, and heart. Yeah, well, they wrote it for me, so I just get to say it. But again, these metaphors, I think, are really, really important, okay? So when you are fully identifying the problem, when you’re fully doing conflict resolution, you want to include this. You want to include, the ears, the eyes, the undivided attention. In undivided attention, there’s no room for “Yeah, but; but me.., but you always, but but but” and one of the things you find with conflict, is right away people go into defensive mode. </para>
    <para id="id1171493420498">So there are several different ways to resolve conflicts: Withdrawing, or simply avoiding, “I’m going to ignore that person. There’s soothing or placating, “I’ll do whatever I need to just to get thru this situation.” There’s compromising, “okay, I’m willing to give up want I have to give up.” There’s forcing, “I’m going to force” or “I’m going to be forced to do it,” okay? There’s collaborating, there’s working together and just trying to get through it again as fast as possible. And there’s confronting or problem solving. And again, it very much depends, a situation, can be resolved in all of these ways. I bet most of us have used all of these ways; they’re certainly ways where we just say, “I’m not going to deal with this one.” And I think that you want to pick your battles, and you especially want to be sensitive to the fact that I’m talking to a group of people who, and </para>
    <para id="id1171496803463">this is perhaps not the happiest statement to make, but to some extent, you don’t have a lot of power in the situation that you’re in. Post-docs, you have more power than graduate students, but you don’t have an assistant professor position. Assistant professor positions are not, they involve less power than having a tenured position. So on top of this conflict resolution and conflict styles, there’s a lot of power differentials. And that’s sometimes what makes up the basis of conflict, or why conflict is so difficult to resolve because the chips are much higher for one side of person. Okay, if we talk about something like publications, where I am in the publication. Well, if I’m the faculty member and you’re the graduate student or the post-doc, I get to make the decisions, and you are, you don’t have a lot of recourse. I mean, there is some recourse, I’d like to tell you about that, it’s a hole, there’s a lot of power issues that come into play if you argue too much if your advisor, or with your post-doc advisor. So I think that’s an important thing to understand as well, which is power differentials are often underlying, or exacerbating conflict. </para>
    <para id="id1171493420548">Okay, so let’s go ahead and go through some of these things. Let’s go through the process of what you do.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420557">The first thing, you want to do, and we’re going to go through this. This is between two people, and we’re going to go through this with different types of a people and what a mediator does. So first let’s say, you’re now thinking of that issue, that person that you’re in conflict with. And you want to solve it yourself. So the first thing you want to do, is just stop, don’t think about it. Just cool off, go away from the situation. So you’ve just been with this person, let’s call it your advisor. Can I ask for a show of hands of who thought of their advisor, or is that like? You guys aren’t allowed to … Their advisor is mean, just so you know, okay. So we’re not going to have honest, we’re just not going to know. Let’s think of that conflict you have, okay? And let’s think. I want you to imagine these scenarios.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420581">So the first thing, you’ve just come out of their office, or you’ve come out of an interaction. That’s not the time to go back in and say, “This is it, I’m resolving it.” First thing to do, is to cool down. Second thing, is to talk and listen to each other. So in order to do this, you’ve got to do somethings, you’ve got to find a neutral spot. If you have no power going back to the professor’s office or the boss’s office is not an equal playing field for you. You’re going into his/her turf, and you’d really like to be an equal. So you say, “Hey, could we met in wherever.. some room. Can we meet for a coffee? Can we go talk about this somewhere?” and you’re going to talk and listen to each other.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420606">Now there’s specific rules for talking and listening, and I’ll just preview these a little bit. There are a little hard to do when you are, when you don’t have a third person. Because very quickly, it gets into a problems of defensiveness and ground rules. But essentially, what you want to do is you really want to listen to the other person. Let the other person try to set some ground rules, and say “I’m here because I have a conflict with the way that you do X, and I would like to, perhaps, have you explain to me why you do it, and for me to listen to that, and then I will explain to you the issue that I have or I would be </para>
    <para id="id1171493420625">happy to tell you how something is making me feel, and then perhaps, you could explain and try to tell me so that I can come to an understanding.” Nothing in that language has been accusatory of someone trying to hurt me, okay? Nothing in that language has been accusatory of me trying to be bitter back to this person. So the goal is to identify the situation and to hear people out. </para>
    <para id="id1171508381980">(inaudible question)</para>
    <para id="id1171493997514">Right, right, and that’s why I say it’s between two people, and it’s for certain situations. Because we’re going to come to a situation, where it’s often best to have a third person. And if you, so, what do you do if you want to this on your own? The best person, is to let them know ahead of time, I think have this with an advisor too. This is just a generic people. Maybe we can wait for a second; but what I do, is what I say, in this situation, I send an e-mail ahead of time and I just say, “I was wondering if we could meet in a neutral area to talk about blank, and you give a preview.” But again, not in a negative, self-destructive or other-person-destructive way. “I’m trying to come to an understanding about the decision, and I was hoping we can reflect on that, so we can come to some understanding.” And that person still may not be aware of what the situation, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171494738754">(.. why is he asking me to? I don’t even want to talk to him.)</para>
    <para id="id1171506211661">Right, if you feel that way, what I would not do, is I would not get into anything over e-mail. Maybe the best thing to do, is let’s erase that, and you go to them directly, and say ‘at some point in time, can we talk about this?” E-mail can be the worst thing, okay? Because you might write something innocuous and it’s totally innocuous, so you might write something funny, but now their guard is up. So they’re saying every little misspelling, as you “you meant to misspell that, it corrected you, but you meant it.” I think what I’m trying to get at, is you want to give them time to at least to know that you want to talk about something in a neutral spot, without giving it away, without telling them right there and then. Perhaps it’s a good time for them there, and at that point, you can do it. So I’m not suggesting you send out something that they’re going to slap down, and say “no.” I’m suggesting that you somehow get a place where it’s not their office, where it’s not your domain, but it’s a neutral domain where you can talk, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493420656">(inaudible question… first step you are a post doc, proposal)</para>
    <para id="id1171493420662">“Let’s go to coffee. Can we go to get a coffee?”</para>
    <para id="id1171493420668">(and now the other person is not ready to discuss. Just trying to solve the conflict and you both get in the way. How do you ?)</para>
    <para id="id1171493420673">So what you have to do is to be fair to the other person to, and the way that you do that is you might say, “there are somethings that I wanted to talk to you about, and I wanted to hear your reaction to them and give you my sort of feelings on this as well, but in order to do that, I want to be able to tell you and have you think about them, and maybe we can pick this up again later,” okay? So that you should allow them sometime to process it too. Because if you just come there, they have no idea, they didn’t think there was any conflict, and you’ve already gotten to the conflict resolution, you’re not giving them enough time to overcome it. So it may be that, you have to, and remember, this is why you choose your battles carefully. This is a big issue, because sometimes if it’s just a little issue, people are so defensive that it becomes even greater. It’s like “oh, that’s the worst thing to do. Now so and so’s mad and I only meant that I was a little teeny upset,” okay. So you’re not doing these with things that, like, what’s appropriate? I don’t know. I don’t know what conflicts you were thinking about. So let’s say you had 3 papers you thought were going to come out with your authorship on it, and you’re not on any of the three. That would be a problem. That’s an impasse, that’s something where you have to do something. This isn’t something like, ‘Geez, my advisor isn’t giving me the time on the machine that I thought I should get. He or she is only giving me 6 hours instead of 8.” Maybe that is a big issue. You’ll know it when it is a big issue. Some of you have the big issues, and those are impassables, those are ones you need to solve. And again, this is very difficult to do because you are leading it. It might be a better situation if it’s a really big one, to bring in the mediator. And the mediator can go to the other person, and inform the other person, and that person comes to you and informs the person, and that person gets people together, okay? So some of this is possible to do on your own, and not possible to do on your own. And you just want to think through these steps. How will it go? But yeah, clearly, if that person doesn’t have any clue, you’re going to need a time where you can introduce it. And you’re going to need a time where they can go away and think about it, and then you’re going to need to come back, okay? And remember, they are probably going to get defensive, so it’s really important how you lay it out in the beginning. You don’t want to be like, “you did this, you did that, you did this, you did that,” what you want to do is phrase in terms of “I”.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420753"/>
    <para id="id1171493420757">“I feel”, “it is my experience”, “I am having a difficult time”, “I’m experiencing this”, rather than “you” because “you” is pointing fingers and it may just be your interpretation. And one of the things you find from mediation is that. And spouses are notorious with this. They are so good at reading the behaviors and the subtle paraverbal behaviors that they’ll look at each other. Let’s say Enrika is my spouse right now, they go, “What?! I didn’t do anything” and Enrika says, “Jesus, it was just a look, I didn’t, wasn’t even, I was looking at the wall behind you. I wasn’t even looking at you.” Like we set each other off, just by looking at each other. Do we do that, married couple? We have a married couple here.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420782">We might be calling upon them, okay? Yeah, and I mean you’re ready on the 6<sup>th</sup> you did that, you are, you do do do, when none of that was inferred, okay? And so you need to make sure that when you do this, you’re talking about “I”. You are owning everything. They may not know mean to be mean to you, they may have a reason for what they’re doing, and you can’t say, “you, you made me look like a fool, you gave me too much </para>
    <para id="id1171497716827">work.” You can say, “I feel like you gave me too much work.” But you’re not inside their head, and you don’t know why they did it. And you don’t know why they did it and even when you’re married, even when you think, for sure you did. Because you got the two years of proof, or the 17 years of proof, okay? And that’s, and truly, that is one of the biggest reason for people fighting. They’ll fight over, again, the color of the walls. “No, it’s not! You always do that! You always disagree with, you always say …” and all of a sudden it’s not about the color of the walls, it’s about the habits of fighting. And so that’s what you really want to get away from. You want to get away from the generalizations to what the issue is about, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171493420804">Yeah, go ahead, no no, go ahead. I want all the questions.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420810">(The conflict has already taken place, now you are finished with stuff and put off, and now it’s time, you feel like it’s time to, you know, approach the person. Now you… possibility that the person will say, ‘I don’t want to talk about it’ so I think that this is just a hypothetical, not fully hypothetical, but let’s say that so that you can correct me if this is how you should do it. So, now next time to prove the person to talk, and you’re approaching it with ‘I’ statement and it’s your turn. You want to decide whether this is really the time whether you should approach it or not, because you don’t want to be, you know, because that’s only one opportunity that you get. Every time you approach, you are delaying, so how do you see that the other person is ready or not?)</para>
    <para id="id1171493420829">I think if the person says, “no” to you “I don’t want to talk about it,” then I think it’s probably you do not feel resolved about it. It’s possibility time, and again, I think the answer is “it depends.” But you want to think about how big is the issue. You want to weigh the cost and benefits of letting it go. Like, you want to think about the position that you’re in, you want to think about is this something I need resolved? I have to, these are 3 publications, and I need to be on them. I need to have this resolved. Or is this, the implications of what you said, make me think that you are racist, and I don’t know if I can work with you anymore. Well, it turns out lots of people are racist, we might just have to let that one go. So again, it depends on the content and how important, or maybe I’m wrong. Maybe you can say, “geez, the 3 publications, don’t matter at all, and it really bothers me to have to work with someone who is racist.” It’s sort of like, how much dissonance or conflict you feel needs to be resolved. But to me, when you say, when that person says to you, “No, I’m closed for business,” I think that’s when it is potentially time to involve a third person and get a mediator. If it’s important, that’s right. Because, otherwise, you’re just going to get; that person is not ready; that person is not cooled off. That person is not welcoming, and it’s hard to make someone be neutral, when they’re not approaching the conversation. You can’t force it on them, they got to be ready. And that’s part of it. The ground rules are just so critical. It’s so critical you go to a neutral spot, and that both parties are willing to be there. If you don’t do that, it’s so hard to do it. And then you got to involve somebody else. Okay.</para>
    <para id="id1171493420883">So you brainstorm solutions. So this is, I like to think about this whole thing with somebody, like you have a friend, you have a partner, you have somebody that you love, </para>
    <para id="id1171493420890">“hey, we love each other, let’s try to solve this on your own.” This is somebody in your lab, so these are good opportunities to do it yourself, sort of. So you can think of solutions, so “hey maybe we can do this, or maybe we can do that.” And you are invested in that person, and that person is invested in you. And you choose the idea that you both like, and you make a plan, and you go for it. </para>
    <para id="id1171493420906">Now I’m not trying to say that this is easy work. It’s still very difficult. But let’s move on. This is something you try with your own, with a relatively, just sort of the framework that you use, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493420920">Embedded in these frameworks, are sort of an SOS. So the SOS – steps of resolving conflict are Story, Options, and Solutions. So each person tells his or her side of the story, including using a “I” message to say how he, to say how each feels. Okay. So this comes to mediation, which we’ll talk about in a second. But mediation, and this S, this first S is really about saying, I’ve forgotten your name, Sujas? So, Sujas and I have worked on a project together and Sujas has dropped the ball on it. I’ve done the work, and Sujas has not. I’m the protagonist in this story. But actually it turns out that Sujas worked on another project before and he carried all the weight, so he was like “I’m not carrying the weight for Micky this time.” So he was kind of mad at me and he was, like, suspending his work because he didn’t want to get sucked in and get no credit again. So, the story goes like this: somebody says to us, or we say to each other, “Okay, Sujas, we’re going to talk about this, and I’m going to tell my story, and I want to hear your story. So I say, “Sujas, this is the deal” and I’m just going to shoot ahead to mediation. Because in mediation, what is going to happen is, Sujas is going to have to tell me what he heard me say. So, and I really, if I really wanted to pick on you two, I could really do this, and I could bring out some stuff, but I’m not going to do that, because I don’t want to make it worse. And I want you to try and go home, figure out sometimes. Sometimes, this actually like makes people mad. Because it’s very hard to do. And all you have to do is go home with your partner and try it. So Sujas, the first thing is I’m going to tell you how I feel, and you’re going to have to tell me what you heard me say, and what you have to do. It’s easy to, well it’s not always easy to listen, it’s very difficult to repeat it back as you heard me say it, without also bringing in your own, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493420972">“So Sujas, I worked on this project entirely, it was my feeling that you weren’t there, and I experienced this sort of, um, what I perceived a negative attitude from you when I tried to get help, it didn’t seem like you were there. I felt like I was doing it all by myself, and I was wondering if you could explain that to me.” Okay, so now we’re going to stop and you’re going to say what you heard me say, and it’s going to be relatively easy for you to do because this really didn’t happen, so you can’t really come up with defenses. But go ahead and try you’re best if you can. </para>

Now bring in emotions with it and bring on the fact that you are pissed off, and you’re processing this with a lot of emotions and it becomes really difficult.

I might need your help on the writeup a little bit because the terminology surrounding blah blah blah is a little difficult, but I am willing to take that. Would that be fair?” And so, what we’re trying to do is really make sure. And you know, it is not kumbayah, let’s sit around and hold hands. It works, it really, really does work.

I think I could do it better than you could because I’ve had mediation training and I’ve tried to use it on my husband a whole lot, okay? </para>

Would it be okay if I stopped over”, okay? At that point in time, you can kick in some of those things, and you do find that they truly do work, especially if you get people. It’s hard to be the mediator and one of the person’s in the conflict. So until you have ability to really understand it. I’m certain, certainly, when I’m really in the conflict, it’s difficult for me too. But when you’re the mediator, it makes total sense. You can see it because as the mediator, you, I would like to move to that, if we could. Because I think when you’re the mediator, you can see it so clearly. You can say, “Yeah, he’s really pissed at her, cause he did all the work on the first one, and she’s like all mad and stuff, but where was she on the first one?” So you say, “Okay, I get it.

    <para id="id1171493604123">We’ve talked about advisors, what happens if they just. I’m going to move ahead a little bit, so just stay with me. So some lessons, those who resolve conflicts attack the problem, not the person. So one of the ground rules of mediation, there will be no name-calling. If there is name-calling, there is apologies. If somebody apologizes and they truly apologize, “I’m sorry” that’s not the opportunity to say, “Ah! See I won! They said they’re sorry.” Saying sorry is one of the hardest things in the world. It’s the hardest thing in the world, and when somebody says they’re sorry to you, and they’re really, truly sorry, the best thing you can do is have an open heart. That is really the best thing you can do, and that’s one of the keys to mediation. I made a mistake. I truly made a mistake, and I am very sorry for that, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171493421227">That’s all you can do. Sometimes you can go back and erase it, other times you can’t. And so you have to say you’re sorry, and you have to let them stand. That’s all you’ve got. So to be gracious and accept that is just one of the rules, it’s a rule. Accusing the person accelerates or widens the conflict and provokes self defense. Attacking the problem leads to resolving the conflict and conflict resolution is a process. </para>
    <para id="id1171493421245">This is what, I think your question was really good because it often does, if it’s a big thing, it often does involve revisiting the situation. It’s not like “Okay, we met, and now we’re happy and going to go about business.” It involve saying ‘How we doing? How are we, are we getting on?” And you don’t always say “How we doing?” after the big crisis, and you’re watching and saying, “Are things better now?” And again, that happens when you’re in a relationship. It happens when you’re in a friendship and you’ve had a big argument, and it’s a real big argument, you kind of get back with that person, and you say, “Gosh, are things going to be the same? Are they going to be different? Are they forever changed?” So it’s the same when you have a big conflict, as well. Yes?</para>
    <para id="id1171493421272">(inaudible question – you realize that it’s probably better, that just you know, put in an apology, and other person and you depend on other person and that other person will respond well)</para>
    <para id="id1171493421279">Okay, so I’m in an argument with you and I apologize and you go, “see? I was right!” Then I think, you continue to carry on, we’re getting into a situation when we need a mediator because a mediator does not allow somebody to say, “I’m sorry.” “Uh! See I was right.” It’s not, it’s just not helpful mediation. At the end of helpful mediation, you again come to a conclusion about this is what I hear, this is what I heard, now are we okay with this? What does this mean to you? What does this mean to you? And the </para>
    <para id="id1171493421297">ground rules are going to be no name-calling. And they’re going to be, you have to be honest, you have to say what’s on your mind. If you’re going to come to this, and I’m going to waste my time to be with you to mediate this, then you need to be talking to each other, and you need to be frank with me. And we found all these other people to substantiate your claims, so going into it, I have a really good idea how you feel about all this stuff. So if I hear you start, just sort of kowtowing, “mmhmm, fine fine” and “oh yeah, exactly what you said,” I’m going to know because I’ve done my work as a mediator. Okay. So there’s no single best, ‘this is it’ depends on. </para>
    <para id="id1171496681871">So we’re getting into conflicts with advisors, and this is clearly something that many of you might face. And Enrika asked a question, “well, what happens if the conflict involves something with an advisor and the advisor says ‘well, this is just the way you do it’” and certainly, I would like to say that a lot of people conflict with the most with advisors: authorship, that’s the big one because those are sort of the golden chips, right? I mean, that’s why you’re doing a post-doc, cause often times you’re getting experience, publications. In graduate school, you’re getting your Ph.D., you’re trying to jump through the hoops, so it’s often “Am I ready to do this? Help me with this. Help me with that. And am I getting publication credit?” There’s conflicts about working styles, amount of work that you’re doing, the priorities that you’re setting, documenting “well, you told me to do this, and now you’re changing it”, okay? All I had to do is think about all the things I do wrong. Not enough, use of, and late for meetings. Not knowing expectations. If you don’t get to meet with your advisor, you often don’t know the expectations, or you try to do something and you just, you didn’t do it like the advisor wants it, and they say “well…” and so they’re weren’t clear expectations set.</para>
    <para id="id1171493421345">If you’re a graduate student, and now I switch the coins, I switch the sides a little bit, or a post-doc, and you’re grading other people. The grade changes, I just thought it was funny. I was writing this talk, phone rings, and it’s right here “hello?” “Yes, I’m calling you and I was wanting to talk to you about my grade, can I come to your office hours?” And I say, “Well, you can come to my office hours, is it something I can clear up on the phone? Perhaps we can talk?” And she said, “Yes, that would be great. I have an 89.03, and I was wondering if there was anything I can do to get extra credit.” So this is the curse of the B+.</para>
    <para id="id1171497832227">Now, so there’s a lot of the grade arguments and the changes and things like that. When we go into that, attitude, personality, and then harassment. There can be some real serious things as well, and not that other things aren’t. These are legal repercussions. So going back again to Enricka’s comment. There are several different strategies that people have when they work with students, okay? What if your student has this sort of ‘it’s my way or the highway’, ‘you do what I say or you leave’, um, they can be punishing. They could say to you, ‘if you’re going to complain about this, I’ll give you more work’, or ‘I’ll stop you from progressing’. They can placate, ‘oh yeah, I hear what you say, I’ll give that some consideration’ but they never do anything. They can be defensive, ‘don’t you think I know what’s best for you?’, um, ‘you know, when I was a graduate student, you should have seen what I had to do’ and ‘this is only fair.’ The power differential is </para>
    <para id="id1171493421373">something to consider and the potential embarrassment that you have in going to your advisor and perhaps crying in front of your advisor, and then you have to go back. And you might feel bad about that. I think all of my students have cried in front of me and I’ve cried in front of them. </para>
    <para id="id1171493421382">So, this slide I wanted to get to about your question, okay? Because undoubtedly, we all do have or had or will have different advisors and different superior styles and they think, you know, there are some real things to think about when you’re dealing with power differentials and you still, you need to address the issue with somebody who does know how to work to you. And they think the first thing you want to do is you want to always show respect. So you go to this person, you know there’s probably no way this is going to change, I really feel like I should get authorship, and I’m not going to get it, but I feel like it’s important that I go and do this for my own personal stake. Like, maybe I won’t get authorship, but if this is a big enough issue to me, then I feel like I need to address it. So the first thing you want to do is make sure that you have respect for that individual, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493421404">Respect is important in any of the domains, whether they’re the subordinates, whether they’re the same – coworkers, but, it’s also important because this is your superior and we know that respect towards superiors is something that we learn early on. You’re subordinate and you may not know the situation from the other side, so these are things that might be reasons to things to think about, okay? Somebody once told me when I was a graduate student, ‘well, graduate students always overestimate how much, in fact, everybody overestimates how much they participate in the project.’ There’s something called ‘effort reports’ that we have to do when we go up for tenure or for promotion, and we have to say, ‘here’s a paper, and on this paper, 27% of it was my idea’, which I think is funny, because how do you get 27%? But let’s just say you could do 10, 30, 50, 100%. And if you take those and add them up, I’m quite sure, and add them up with the other people who are participating, I’m quite sure that would get estimates over 100%, okay? Just as when you ask men or women how much of the housework they do, it reaches over 100%, okay? And they say, you know, come on, let’s be real, here. So people think that they do more than they actually do. So then there’s the issue, there’s a perception thing. Some of it is, you may not know, and I think that it’s important to know: when you’re an undergraduate, do you remember ever thinking, ‘my gosh, I worked so hard but I’ll never work this hard again’? And then you became a graduate student and you thought, ‘oh, lord, that was easy’, okay? And then you become an untenured professor going up for tenure and you go, ‘this is SO much work’, okay? And then you become promoted in full, and they put you on P&amp;T committee and they ask you to be department chair and they ask you to do all these other things, and you’re like, ‘I can’t even do it anymore. I can’t even’ so you have these undergraduates who are working with you who think, “Well, I put ALL of my free time into this’ and you like ‘you don’t even know’ okay? So there is this whole thing to ‘you really don’t know’ how much of the effort you did, you don’t have this whole idea about when was it formed out, how much of this was done before I came into it, how much gets it revised, and sometimes you do. Sometimes you do, but be aware that this other person holds all sorts of information about the topic that you don’t hold, and you’re trying to fact find. So you’re trying to say, ‘just make it clear </para>
    <para id="id1171496832114">to me how this comes out because I’m trying to understand this.’ So again, it may not be that you’re going to come out with that A- like the woman wanted this morning, but I do feel in the end she understood that I’m a person of integrity. That I raise, I gave everyone 2 extra points on their final grade and that if I raised hers .97, I would have to raise everyone’s .97 because that would be a fair thing to do. Then there would be somebody in the class that then was that .818 away from it, and could I really deny them the .818 away from it? And if I gave them the .818, there would be somebody else that would be .06 away from it from that increase, and the world goes on and go, and therefore, they’re going to have to be forever stigmatized with the curse of the B+, okay? And by the way, I’ve had the B+ too, and thank you very much. You know, but I let her talk, and I talked with her about it, and at the end, she said ‘thank you, that’s very fair’ and I said ‘well, my office hours if you want to come in and talk about it more, you can’. And she seemed to be, the subject seemed to be talked out.</para>
    <para id="id1171502562460">The appointment, again the appointment thing, the preview and discuss, the anticipate potential reactions from a powerholder, okay? Can you get fired? I mean, can you, what is the organization culture like at this place? Like, what happens if you do argue against the person? What are the cultural implications? What are the potential costs and benefits to doing this? Will the person, can the person yell at me? Will the person make me cry? Will it be worse than I think? And you don’t know the answers to many of these, but you can at least think about them, especially when the stakes may be high, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171493421497">Don’t burn bridges if you have, leave feeling worse. You may not have done it correctly, or you find out that the person you are working with is really not a good person. And that’s one of the things you find out. And then you’ve got an even bigger conflict. You’ve got a conflict called ‘I work for a person that’s not a very good person and what do I want to do?’ And at that point, if the person does something very egregious, like doesn’t give you credit, isn’t developing you as a person, isn’t doing the ethical things that they are supposed to be doing as a trainer, then may be time to think about, ‘okay, I need to remove myself,’ what are my options? My options at that point in time are to really go to a mediator, to make a formal complaint, to remove myself from the situation and work with another person, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171497313136">So alternatives to confronting an advisor about conflict or particularly, or if it’s egregious, find an ally in your department. This may be another post-doc, it may be a senior graduate student, it may be a trusted advisor, another trusted professor in the department. Or you can go to the area head, a lot of times there’s the graduate student representative for post-docs. It may be other post-docs, or it may be that the department had this wel, head. The dean, at Rice University, and I imagine at most of these other places, there’s the Director of Equal Employment Opportunity Program, okay? So you can go visit that person. And there’s Human Resources, and people can document ‘I have something egregious about this person and I would like to make a, I would like to file a grievance.’ And the reason it’s really important, and I’m not trying to get you all to go and file grievances, but I am getting you all to try to file grievances if it’s an egregious act, okay? Because when we have people who are tenured and who are there with safety </para>
    <para id="id1171493421532">and security, grievances can help remove them if enough grievances are collected. That is the one thing that can help remove truly unethical people and people who are doing bad things, but we need proof of that. So if somebody is doing something very egregious, there is a way to help.</para>
    <para id="id1171493421543">I think I’ll save this. I was going to say that handling student conflicts are the same and I have a wonderful TA this semester who got an e-mail from a student about the 8 points that she was cheated on, or she felt she wasn’t graded correctly on, and she wrote a point by point comparison, maybe I’ll just give you a couple of the highlights. Maybe that’s what I’ll do. Maybe if I can find them. I hope I’ve brought them. Oh, darn. Okay, I didn’t bring them. I’ll just tell you: The person had obviously gotten into a situation where she felt like she was on a roll. She was going to let us know about each infraction of each of the 8 points and how they were misgraded. Now, the nice thing is it wasn’t really directed at me cause I don’t do the grading. But it was directed at the TAs and they didn’t really like it very much. And so, it was kind of mean spirited, and at the end, it said something like, you know, ‘and how are we supposed to mind read?’ and there were just, you can see the insults, she had gone from objectivity, to let me throw this in for extra spirit, this is a game. And Amy wrote back, I mean, I was just so impressed because what I have learned to do is to just say at this point, ‘just come to my office, I would rather explain this than write it out in a two hour email.’ But Amy took the time to write it out, and she said, and it was just so beautifully crafted, it basically said, “Here are the responses, and now I would like to give you a little professional advice. I would like you to read this message that you wrote to me in about a week from now and imagine how you would feel if you were a graduate advise, if you were a TA who was doing this for 20 hours a week and this were your job, how would you feel if this message came to you? And the reason I ask this is, is that you might want to know in the future that these sorts of things can be seen as very hostile and while I am taking this time to develop you and to help you understand this, not all people would do this,” okay? And it was so nicely articulated. It was about four screens, and the person wrote back and said a few more things, but seemed to come to an understanding and apologized and Amy wrote back again and said, “I’m glad to help you developmentally.’ It was the message we all know we should write if we have enough time, but it’s the message that most of us don’t take time to write, and it was very much in keeping with the, ‘I’m going to be a mediator, I am not going to react to this message, I am going to tell this person’, and at the end, the person had something like ‘you know, I feel like I was really graded unfairly on all of these things’ and Amy reminded the student that there’s also the effect that you are probably, just as there were some items you were graded more difficultly, there were some items you were probably leniently graded, you know? And it was just such a beautiful consider these options, too. </para>
    <para id="id1171498046905">That’s the time we should all take. We don’t have that time, we’re in a very fast paced thing, so I think sometimes the keys to conflict in reducing the conflict is just to slow down, cool off, and do not engage in e-mail warfare, okay? Because e-mail warfare is a permanent record, okay? You’re putting things in paper, it gets very, very close to harassment, discrimination, negativity, unprofessionalism, anything you want to like add in there as well, and you’ve got it permanently. So don’t engage, if you want to engage </para>
    <para id="id1171493421620">in e-mail, then write the e-mail, send it to yourself and read it a few days later, ask somebody else to read it, make sure that somebody else is somebody who doesn’t have a hot head, okay. </para>
    <para id="id1171493974829">Here’s the mediation process. First step, both sides agree to solve the conflict. We come back to your comment, I’ve forgotten your name. Persia, we come back to your question. What if person B doesn’t want to meet? We can’t solve the conflict. The mediator has to say, ‘Are both of you willing to meet’? This has to be something where people want to meet to resolve it. So we’ve agreed to get together, Sam and Jisoo are going to get together, and they’ve taken a cooling off period. They are ready to come to me, I am the mediator. </para>
    <para id="id1171494052794">Second step, and this is again, what you learn in mediation training. It is wonderful. So Katie and Ben, you learn this, take this home. And I don’t want to be your mediator, though. Okay. So these are the ground rules, so we’re going to meet, Jisoo and Sam, we’re going to meet in the BCR because we don’t have any business here, this is a neutral place so we’ll come to this classroom, we’ll grab some coffees, we’ll feel relaxed, we’ll just sit and we’ll talk. Alright, here are the ground rules: One, we’re going to treat each other with respect, no blaming, no put downs, we don’t call each other insults, and I’m the referee. So if I say, ‘zzzz, you called him a name,” you have to apologize ‘I’m sorry, Sam.’ You attack the problem, not the person. You wait for your turn to speak, there’s no interrupting. And you work together for a fair solution, and you tell the truth, okay? Parroting should be in there well, as well. You learn parroting skills, so parroting is, you’re going to say exactly what you experienced then Sam is going to come back and say, “what I heard you say” and in your parroting, and you’re telling about the problems, you’re owning it. You’re saying “I… I…I… I felt as if… it is my perception that … I experienced…” not “You’re a bum, you’re a blah blah blah blah blah”, okay? That’s the referee blows the whistle on those sort of things. So, we’ll tell you the reason this works is that when you parrot, when you say “Ah, I get it” a lot of times what happens is you perceived the person was upset over X, they weren’t even upset over X. They were upset over Y, and Y is easily addressed, okay? So again, it’s like a ping pong match in high speed. And we’re going to take a cross slice sometimes, and that’s not really understanding the whole game. So what the mediator wants to do is stop and say, “Where is the exact point of conflict here? What’s the breakdown? What is the exact problem? Okay, Jisoo do you see what Sam is upset about? Sam, do you understand why Jisoo is upset with you? Okay, that’s the thing. Is there anything else? Yes, there’s a third thing.” And those three things together are all the same issue, and so now we have out what the issue is. It’s this repeated Jisoo is going into Sam’s space and taking things from Sam. That is what we have to. The notes for that class in social psychology, okay. </para>
    <para id="id1171495295860">So the third step, is mediating with a win-win guideline. So this is again, cooling it off. It’s each person using “I” messages. It’s stating the problem as the other see it. It’s seeing how they’re responsible for the problem, okay? So after we have gone through the “I I I” and the parroting, then I come back as the mediator and I say, “Sam, can you understand why that might be upsetting?” “Yeah, but ….” “No, no, Sam can you </para>
    <para id="id1171493421679">understand what Jisoo has said might be upsetting?” So I’m trying to clarify that experience and then understanding, “yes, okay.” Now explain, and what we’re going to is again, merge a more clarification. It sounds like work, it is work. You don’t want a mediate for something little. You want to mediate for big things. And it works. It really does. Brainstorm solutions together and agree on a solution that satisfied both people, “Okay, Sam, I now want you to say that you understand Jisoo and you want to thank him for his time, okay? And Jisoo, I’d like you to do the same.” Now, this is so effective that there’s mediation training. This is so effective that people are professional mediators. This really works. What if it doesn’t work? Mediation also works for organizations, right? This is like we mediate the dispute, we come in and we do collective bargaining or we do something where there is a mediator. If mediators don’t work, then they can call in arbitrators, and the arbitrator, right?, is the person who says, “I don’t even need to take any information between the two of them, all I’m going to do is I’m going to listen to Jisoo, I’m going to listen to Sam, I’m going to get all of your opinions, and I’m going to decide”, okay? And that’s what you can do at the end. You can’t really do that with your graduate advisor, okay? He’s out of here, okay? She can stay. But you can do that with companies, and just to let you know, that’s how arbitrators and mediators differentiate, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493421725"/>
    <para id="id1171493421729">(question, but arbitrater is like I don’t care)</para>
    <para id="id1171493421734">Yes. They come to a conflict resolution. Yup, that’s it. The arbitrator decides without the parties. The mediator wants the people in the parties to come together and decide, but the mediators is there to facilitate by removing all of the hostilities at both levels, and making sure the people play within the ground rules.</para>
    <para id="id1171493421747">(question, how do you choose a mediator?)</para>
    <para id="id1171493421752">Carefully. You know, it’s kind of like how do you choose a therapist? I mean, there are some natural mediators, okay? So let’s say it’s something in your department, then you can go to the department head. But the department head, if you’re a graduate student, and you’re problem is with a faculty member, you know, the graduate student represents, the person representing the graduate student tends to see things from the graduate student side. The department heads tend to see their clients as the faculty members, so you know, you really want, I mean, if it’s an important question, you know. And I think what you want to do is find somebody who you think will be fair to both, and that may be going and talking to a faculty member who you respect and having them present the situation to the department head because you want the outcome to be significant, you know. You want something to happen. But it’s a really important, you know, you’re question is, right? Cause you’re going to get different, you want it to be somebody who’s fair, who can suspend, and by the way, there are real trained mediators that you can hire as well. And for organizations, they cost way too much to come in and do something like this, but usually people can play the role. And there are local mediators, and I’m not, I know one in California, but I don’t know how you find the local ones as well for smaller issues. There was a question, Yes.</para>
    <para id="id1171493421797">(Question: So my question is, so where’s the accountability on a both side solution? So you brainstorm all these ideas and both of you have to agree to do these things, who’s holding these people to be accountable for actually following through?)</para>
    <para id="id1171506959046">So that also, I hate to say it, but it depends, okay? So some mediators will have people say, “okay, let’s just write up something, it’s not a formal document, but it’s like an informal document, where we’ll both sign these, this is what I can take away to say, and it’s going to up to you two to honor these, okay?” And most of it is honored, or you’ll meet back in mediation. Cause there’s nothing so, one thing you don’t want to do is make people more aware of “Oh my god, now Jisoo is really being like a hawk, is anything on my desk moved? I put a piece of hair there to see if came near and borrowed it, you know.” You don’t want it to be more of a hawk situation. You want it to be something where the two people agree, and that agreement stands. But usually, there’s an investment. People are not comfortable when they come to mediation; they’re not comfortable coming. It does not feel good. And so the end is something that they, that they have accurately and honestly like said, this would be a good outcome, and I forgot to say that when we talk about outcomes, we say, “Jisoo, is that a good outcome for you? Sam, is that a good outcome for you? Are you, can you carry that out? Okay?” So again, it’s sort of a lot of word of mouth, although, you can do an informal document as well. Now when mediators are professional and come in, they actually can write it down too, so there can be formal accountability. But the process, I must tell you, you believe in the process. The process does work.</para>
    <para id="id1171495361119">Other questions? </para>
    <para id="id6082529">Okay, so we don’t have any heads, do we? Department heads? So these are just getting people to understand from the department. Yes?</para>
    <para id="id1171508298396">(I think like that is one of my, one of the reasons that I wanted to come here was, as a, as a manger, as a supervisor of graduate students. It’s kind of, the situation is not there yet, but at some point, we may, this is, maybe this is for my interest if graduate students learn this. But at some point, we can remember and I have students.)</para>
    <para id="id1171494410441">Well, yes. Let’s talk about it now. This is perfect, okay? So what I just told you extends, okay? So for managing conflict as a head, we’re going to go back to the orange, okay? You have to understand the problem before solving, before responding. So now you are the mediator, you’re the head, and this is part of your job, and you can either get professionally trained on mediation experience or you can do it in the ‘do it yourself’ sort of away. And again, what’s it’s going to be like, is the mediation training. So you want to understand, you want to gather information. What you want to do is not, and this becomes especially difficult when you’re the head, when just two months ago, or two days ago, you were best friends with one of the persons in the conflict. You know, you want to take conflict sides, you know you want to take Person B’s side because you and </para>
    <para id="id1171502488609">Person B are buddies, okay? You know, you don’t want to take Person A’s side because you’ll offend Person B, and this is where you really have to suspend that subjectivity. You know that this worker is usually always in the lab working, and this one time she screwed up, but usually she’s always good, and how can you have this meeting and have to come down on her? But the deal is, you really have to identify what the problem is, okay? You have to identify what’s going on. What’s the person’s thing with words? What’s the emotion in the situation? What are the sources of information that can help me understand? So as a, so two of my research assistants are having an argument, two faculty members are having an argument, the first, and they want to talk about it and they want to come to some resolution. Or maybe they don’t want to, but I can say to them, would you like to talk about it? And if both of them say yes, “we would like to meet, this is what happened in our department”, I said ‘yes, let’s meet’ and so, what I did is collect information beforehand. You want to understand what does this person think, what’s going on in this situation, what’s this person’s experience, how does everybody else feel about this, what do I think is the right thing is not entirely relevant, okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171493421861"/>
    <para id="id1171493421865">What’s relevant, what’s really relevant, is what is the outcome that we can make together? What are the different outcomes and what are the best outcomes for everybody? For the whole situation? And so, there’s strategies, again, if you’re going to call this meeting to order, sometimes, its’ best to just wait, to wait and watch, sometimes it’s to affirm positives so you can say, ‘I know that you are struggling with blank, and i just wanted to tell you that I think you’re doing a great job,’ so that there are some positives there too, so it’s not just a focus on those negatives. And you can use the policies in place to form your decisions as well, okay? So according to this policy, we can’t really do that, or what this, your behavior may be, so instead of having that mediation meeting, you may be able to correct one of them with a policy. Because the stakes can be high when you get people together to meet, because you want to make sure it’s an “it depends, yes, this is a scenario where it does make sense.” I mean, you just don’t want to be calling people together all the time over something that is not, you don’t want to be calling people together for something that is trivial, because otherwise, you’re going to be dealing with things every day. I don’t know if you all have read the book, if you haven’t you should, it’s by Richard Rousseau, and it’s called <emphasis effect="italics">Straight Man</emphasis>, and it is a book about academia. And Richard Rousseau is not an academician, but I think it should get an honorary academician degree because he talks about all the ridiculousness about the fact that academia is funny. It’s a comedy. </para>

    <para id="id1171505470348">Okay, and it is an absolute pleasure to read. Isn’t it a pleasure? Okay. And you know, it’s basically all the ridiculousness of academia and the triple trivialities and how in academia, the trivialities are so large because the stakes are so low. We don’t get paid a lot, we don’t have a ton of power, our power’s all department focused, and so I think it’s a really good understanding, of you know, you don’t want to make these trivial situations </para>
    <para id="id1171493421908">into mediation, this is the tool and you can use that tool in a lot of different domains but when you’re really talking about mediation, it’s usually a large conflict where people are really not, somebody’s not doing well, okay?</para>

Brought up to his attention, report it as a supervisor, now you want to … you want your lab to be famous as a good environment. So one of the things I feel like a good supervisor should do himself is... if there’s a conflict among his people, and maybe calling one of those people and mediate them. But he is not).</para>
    <para id="id1171496798755">You know, is it right? It may not be right for me, it may be right for you. I think it’s about, I think what you’re talking about, is you’d like to create an organization climate, a laboratory climate where people get along. And one of the tools may be to identify the people make the place. So if the people are happy, and they’re getting along well, you’ve got a great place. And some of the tools of mediation may work very well, I think there’s also, so so, yes, you can use some of those tools, I think you can also want to avoid the potential of micromanaging. Oh, they’re getting involved in that situation and it really wasn’t a problem. Somebody called me a name, but I knew they were just joking. And if the advisor or that lab manager says, “listen, we need to talk about that name’ when it wasn’t, it was momentarily insulting to me, they called me a ‘liberal whatever’. Then, “well, I kind of am,” but you know, if somebody like now, gets us together and says, “well, you’re a liberal” and that really hurt my feelings. So if they said that to you, you know, so I think you want to play that balance delicately. And take into account what you’re trying to build, what the culture is like now, what the climate is like now, if it needs to change, if it does need to change, then I think these can be tools, or maybe just an open forum for how would y’all like the column to change? What would you like it to be like? And what can we do to get it there? So it’s sort of like inviting everyone in, but not singling people out, or ‘you did this, you did that, I think that was a problem.’ I think mediation, if you’re going to be a mediator, it often happens. You can say to the people, ‘if you have problems, I am here, no matter how big or how small,” but again, sometimes, the wait and watch is a good strategy because you don’t want to be that micromanager, so you want to kind of wait to be invited as the mediator role. Does that make sense?</para>
    <para id="id1171493421998">Decisions should be made, okay so this is this is, now. Again, it depends. So now I’m going to read this, so I’m going to over it three times. Decisions should be made for the whole group, not individuals. So let’s say that you got somebody in your lab who is just </para>
    <para id="id1171493422012">like ridiculously loud or insulting or there are situations where individuals behaviors are problematic and you want to make decisions for the whole of the group. So if somebody is out of line, maybe it’s a situation a good time to think about mediating or doing something that was resolves things. Always listen respectfully and I think that I don’t listen well enough. I think sometimes that I talk too much and too quickly and don’t always hear everything I need to. And I think a lot of us do that. We live in a very fast paced society, where it’s like, “okay!” and my husband, he’s a talker. He grew up as one of eleven children, and I always say, “give up the conch!” You know the conch is this reference to this book. And whoever has the conch, the shell, gets to talk. <emphasis effect="italics">Lord of the Flies</emphasis>. I’m like “what’s the book?” But yeah, <emphasis effect="italics">Lord of the Flies</emphasis>. I’m like ‘give up the conch, honey!” Well, in his like household, they never gave up the conch, because they never get the conch. So once they got the conch, they hold onto it, and they “blahblahblahblah” and they, so I’m like ‘oh my god, do I akjaskldjklasjf’ and I have to listen, and sometimes I’m like ‘okay, I try to say to myself, be a better listener.” Be a listener, don’t try to judge people immediately when they come into their office of, “I know what this person is going to say, here’s your solution.” Like really listen to what they’re saying, and practice parroting. Say, “So, what I think you’re saying is that you’re worried about this, is that correct? Okay?” And then you have carefully identified what the problem is. Um, leading by punishment is never a good strategy. Unified purposes are good. Again, thinking about the whole group. Harmony occurs when everybody participates, so again, these are, these are not just clichés, but these are sort of clichés about conflict resolution. And minority voices need to be heard. They just must be heard. Okay. </para>
    <para id="id1171506130415">I think we’re almost at the end. I can’t believe how long that took us. Is conflict good? I return to this slide. Some of it is good, it’s often part of the growing experience, it feels uncomfortable and propels us to action. So remember, some of this is very good, but some of it is bad, it’s a precursor to major stress and depression and inability to perform well, and preoccupation with the situation or person. And what I’ll end with is a quote from Albert Einstein: “Peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved by understanding.” So it’s really about what are we trying to do in conflict? Well, we’re trying to argue our point over another person’s point. We’re trying to advocate something. We’re upset by something. So ultimately, what we want is two people understanding each other so we can free up the misunderstanding and try to choose an optimal solution, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493427459">With that in, I will stop. I’m super happy to answer questions about conflict resolution, or to do anything additional, if you’d like. Okay?</para>
    <para id="id1171493427468">Yes?</para>
    <para id="id1171493427472">(A friend talked to me about a book, it came out of some Harvard study about conflict resolution and it’s a book called <emphasis effect="italics">Getting to Yes</emphasis>, I haven’t read the book so I really don’t know much. But one of the ideas he took away about was this concept that of identifying interests rather than positions. So you have two people coming in and they each come in </para>
    <para id="id1171495685370">with positions they want, they’ve already anticipated the other side, so they’re staking out their positions and they’re going to defend them. Whereas the mediator needs to find out, have them articulate what their interests are. What do they actually care about? Not the positions they have to defend, it may be in the example of the orange once, one of the interest had interest in orange juice, and the other interest was they wanted to make zest. But they’re position is that they wanted to occupy the orange. But actually, the problem was, but as long as they were focused on their position, they weren’t going to get anywyere.)</para>
    <para id="id1171493427493">Yeah, I think that’s a great point. It also reminds me something else that I didn’t mention about conflict resolution, which is a little bit similar, which is one of the ways to resolve conflicts for the social psychology graduates. By social psychology, I mean upperclass. Okay? We know it’s superordinate goals. Okay, so moving people to agreeing, “okay, we want something and we want it together and this breaks down the disharmony.” So reminding people, “look, what we all want is to get a good education, we all are here because we want to get lots of pubs, you two are arguing over who’s first author and who’s second author, but let’s keep in mind the more you both work, the more pubs there are both of us.” Okay, so if you can get people to understand, again, and it’s kind of like understanding their interest. It’s like if you can remind them what the bigger goals are and how actually you two are unified so it’s not harmonious to be separate because together you can work twice as hard, or you can get as much as, here’s our goals that are together, then it’s also a unifier, you know, rather than segregist. </para>

    <para id="id1171493427527">Yeah, well, I think that, I mean, I could put status in and squish it with ego and I don’t think that status always means big ego, but I think it’s hard to. There are some personality differences that makes ego come out more, right? Sort of stubborn, disagreeableness is harder to deal with. And then, I think status is sort of like that. “I’m a professor. Who do you think you are? You’re just a graduate student.” You know? And again, I think if you choose your mediator carefully, if you choose somebody who is going to say, “Well, I’m a mediator, and I’m a professor too, and come on, you know, let’s hear.” So I think if you have a mediator who is below rank of the highest ranking person, you’re potentially getting into problems. That’s where you really want somebody, that’s why I said when you pick a mediator, you probably wouldn’t pick another graduate student, right? You pick a faculty member who is respected by the other person so that the ego is left at the door. And that’s part of the ground rules too. You know, you can’t pull rank on people. You can’t. We can’t pull rank here. We’re coming to talk about this incident, and if rank is part of that incident, then it’s invited in, but if it’s not, then we need to check it at the door. </para>
    <para id="id1171493427561">(inaudible question) </para>
    <para id="id1171493427565">Well, so this is where one has an ego, and one. I mean, you know. Ideally, you have the referee and this is what the mediator is like, I mean, when you’re articulating the, so you think about spots where egos may show up. They may show up in parroting, “I’m not going to give that person everything,” you know. And that’s where the mediator says, “Oh, they also said blank, and they also said blank,” and the ego person may say, “yeah, yeah, that too.” The mediator says, “No, actually, you need to say that. Actually, I need to hear you articulate that. No, actually, that’s not quite what they said. Um, what they said, can you repeat this?” And then you say again to that individual, “Is that everything? Did they articulate exactly what you’re feeling?” And if they didn’t, they’ll say, “No, actually, this is what I said,” okay? And so and so, “Oh, that’s close enough ---” “It’s not your turn actually.” So the mediator is in control and can, if successful, can put a stop to that very easily, to some extent. </para>

    <para id="id1171493427603">(inaudible question—Why are conflicts repeated with certain people?)</para>
    <para id="id1171493427607">I think if they’re minor and they’re repeated, they get to a level, it’s like a nerve, right? The nerve is an action potential and when stimulated enough, it – what does it do?—excites. It was there! It was there! Thank you, RT Briggs, 1987. So it excites. If it gets to a certain point, it does become a big issue, and then I think it’s time to approach it. And again, some of these, you may not need a mediator. If it’s a little issue, let’s say you wait for your advisor all the time, and she’s always late. I’m just going to give that example, okay? And it’s annoying you because it feels disrespectful. And at the same time, it’s like you don’t really know what to do because you don’t want to, like, have that person, I mean, that’s not a big enough issue where you would call in a mediator, okay? It’s something you feel the person would be responsible, responsive to, I think that’s a situation where you can say, “May I just have a few moments of your time to say something that has been bothering me just a little bit? And I thought telling you, we might be able to solve it. Alright? I might be able to understand you situation.” And when you do it yourself, the only thing you have to do, is you really have to hold yourself accountable to listening and being open, and that’s, that sounds a lot easier than it is. We all have biases when we think we’re the protagonist of all of our stories, and we don’t see our errors and the things we do wrong. We see all the justfications for why we do those things. So if you’re going to approach someone and say, “Hey, you know, you’re, it’s bothering me a little bit because every time we come a meeting, you’re exactly 25 minutes late, okay? And I feel like I’m not that important to you, and that’s what I feel, so I was hoping that we could figure out a system so maybe I wouldn’t have to wait.” And so then, you get into a situation where maybe they say maybe, “Well, I’m sorry you feel that way…” and you have to filter out, it’s really important for you to filter out and not take the fish bait of “Oh, that really feels like an insult, oh, you’re really, really getting close to bothering me.” Somebody says to you, “Well, you know what, I’m really sorry I had these other things.” Or whatever it is. You have to be a responsible party being the mediator too to say, “Oh, okay, I say understand why you’re coming late. That </para>
    <para id="id1171493427650">makes sense.” Or you have to offer some of the suggestions, and let that person process the information as well. In a fair and neutral way, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493427658">(<emphasis effect="italics">parts inaudible</emphasis> usually, when you get to that situation there are …. Do you deal with everything? Knowing that if you don’t deal with everything)</para>
    <para id="id1171497768338">I think what you try to do, is you try to pick, this is a really important question, okay? You do not want to pick 16 issues and bring them up, okay? And you don’t want to pick one issue and bring it up, okay? You want to pick the general category and stay away from specifics. If you say to a person, ‘It really made me angry’ is that good? “It really made angry that you were home late for dinner last Tuesday night, okay?” You have given up all of your power of saying, “It makes me angry when you don’t show up on time for the things that we agree on” because you’ve let that person out by picking one example and getting into specifics instead of the general way that you’re feeling. So if you’re really upset, and what you’re upset about is you feel like you’re not being appreciated. And I could, you want stay sort of broad at that point and say, “I can give you examples if you want, but what I really want to articulate is there are ways that I am not feeling appreciated. And these are the things I feel that would, could improve the situation.” What happens if you just focus on ‘last Tuesday night,’ Person X comes back and says, “Well, my car broke down” and then Person X sees it that all the things that the situation prevented them from being, so they’re excused. So it feels like a laundry list of things coming at them, and they’re there to defend and shoot down each of the ones coming at them, okay? Whereas if you give them the big picture of, ‘there are times’ and again, it’s like, ‘I want you to know the ground rules. I want you to know, first of all, that I love you very much and I’m telling you this because I would very much like to feel better. There are times where you make me feel unappreciated, I just said it wrong. I feel unappreciated by you at times. It is my feeling that sometimes it seems like I’m come out of situations feeling bad and feeling like…” and again, it’s you claiming your feelings, okay? And then they may say, “Could you give me examples?” And then I would, again, still keep them, I wouldn’t go into specifics, but I would say things like, ‘sometimes when we set a time, I feel like I have to wait extra long. Sometimes when I ask you to do things, they don’t always get done. Sometimes” and, but the other thing, is you need to let them go when you tell them. It’s not like “Well, I’ve articulate them and now the score boards up.” So you really do need to articulate in your statement of your issues those things and be free of them. They’re not an “okay, now I’m keeping score.” Okay, does that make sense? Okay.</para>
    <para id="id1171493427709">(inaudible question)</para>
    <para id="id1171493427713">Well, so, there’s a couple different things. One is, what if you tell this person that you want to meet with them, they didn’t know there was a conflict, they’re sort of like flabbergasted, you want to be able to come back and say, can we talk about this more? And, you know, sometimes there’s a wealth of why people get upset. They’re people who get upset because it’s such a cultural norm of “I don’t want to upset people.” People often get upset when they know you’re upset with them. And so there’s this defensive, </para>
    <para id="id1171493427729">“Well, you think you’re mad at me. And now I’m mad at you.” And you go back and forth, and you go, “because of X and two years ago and you did that to me,” and “Oh my god!” and so it’s a really bad thing. So that’s why again, we’re all the protagonists. “What! They’re mad at me? How dare you!” And they think you need to be aware of some of this processing, so you don’t fall prey to it, and that you’re understanding that people, it takes a while for people to take responsibility for their actions, and to not be defensive and take it all in. It’s like, I think especially in situations where you’re telling people, “this is what I feel you’ve done to me to upset me” just to remember it may take a couple times because you have probably done things to upset, you know, what people almost everyone does that kind of bug you, and the horrible thing is you probably do things that bug most people too. At least one or two, okay? I mean, that’s just human life, right? And so there you’re probably going to have a situation where you need to come back, and they’re going to say, “Well, these were somethings that bothered me.” And you go, “Oh my god! Well, now I’m being given this information”, and then hopefully you can work through it, okay? </para>
    <para id="id1171493427766">You know, and I always will say, what I will say and maybe this is a good concluding thought is, “I don’t think you can ever really, I think one of the reasons that relationships are so meaningful, the longer you’re in them, is I feel like once you’ve seen the negative sides of people, once you’ve seen the conflict, you don’t really understand and appreciate people before you see those. You’re relationship gets deepened so much by seeing, ‘okay, I’ve made this person mad, now I understand how they resolve conflict, okay, this is what we have done together, oh we’ve worked through this, I know this person was mad at me, and this is’ I mean, it’s such a rich part relationships and it’s such a part of, it’s a necessary part because it leads to growth, it leads to redirection of people. It leads, you know, to better projects, it leads to people saying, ‘okay, I’m ready to graduate, I’m ready to be on my own because I can start to take on things that you’re giving me’ and argue back my independent reason for asserting them. It tells people what in the relationship is the most important things to work on, so again, I think that conflict is necessary, and I think it could be a really good thing, so long as we approach it as a challenge vs. a threat.</para>

Do I bring all 16 of them up? So I would say, don’t bring all 16 of them up, bring up the latent factor. Sorry, that’s. I. Yeah. Bring up the theme. Bring up the theme.

And if people say, “well, give me some examples.” You can say, “Well, let me just tell you three, and I don’t want to get into them because this is not, this is not, the point is not to have you defend each of them, the point is to let you understand what my experience is. My experience is that, I expected you to be home on time this particular time, I expected you to return my things, I was really disappointed.

I was wondering if you could mediate this or if you could put this person, find out, give me some advice on what I should do, and that may not end in a mediation. It may end in somebody coming back to you and saying, ‘you know what? I think this is something that’s just going to be unresolved for a while because they cannot mediate. They don’t want to talk and you can’t force people into mediation.” Unless it’s organizations. </para>
    <para id="id1171497758527">(So one thing is happens between graduate students and they’re PIs. There is an organization, which in different organizations has different ways, and they can do different things, and it’s often, they’re poorly… because they’re often constructed for the benefit for the advisors. Precisely, when they’re needed for the students.. but they are there in principal and they can be put into practice. So they counts as allies for both parties.)</para>
    <para id="id1171493427896">They do, they do. And I bring this up again because the graduate students are often in a position of just having low status, and just being at the beck and call at their thesis committee members who are professor’s allies. So it’s like, where do you go? And that’s where I think every, most departments have somebody who you know, I can go to that professor. I can shut the door and I can tell them in a trusted way. You know, you hear that down the line, you know who that is. And that’s the person you go to. You hope they’re on your committee. You hope your committee is comprised of people like that, but if they’re not, you find that advocate. And if there is no such advocate, then you go outside your department.</para>
    <para id="id1171494216570">Is that it? Okay? I never got to the rest of the stuff, maybe I can visit you guys again next year.</para>
